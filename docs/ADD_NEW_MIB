We want to document here how to add a new MIB file to our server.

1. create a new empty folder (like mkdir -p "$HOME/add_new_mib" && cd "$HOME/add_new_mib")
2. curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/etingof/pysmi/master/scripts/mibdump.py -o mibdump.py && chmod a+x mibdump.py
3. Now we need to tell mibdump.py where are the new missing MIB files we want to import. You can do this by
   specifying an additional --mib-source parameter with a custom absolute path. In this case, just for semplicity,
   I have copied the MIB file I want to add to our MIB server into the current folder. That's why I have added
   "--mib-source .". As you can see, we need also to tell mibdump.py where to find all the required imports each MIB
   file might have. For example TintriMIB.txt needs these external symbols:
   IMPORTS
    MODULE-IDENTITY, OBJECT-TYPE, OBJECT-IDENTITY, NOTIFICATION-TYPE,
    Integer32, Unsigned32, enterprises
        FROM SNMPv2-SMI
    DisplayString, DateAndTime
        FROM SNMPv2-TC
    MODULE-COMPLIANCE, OBJECT-GROUP, NOTIFICATION-GROUP
        FROM SNMPv2-CONF;
    and these symbols are defined in SNMPv2-SMI, SNMPv2-TC, and SNMPv2-CONF.

4. run mibdump.py --mib-source http://mibs.thola.io/asn1/@mib@ \
                  --mib-source . --destination-format pysnmp \
                  --destination-directory=./temp <your-mib-file>
4.1. If for some reason your environment doesn't have access to Internet (and hence cannot connect to
     http://mibs.thola.io/asn1/@mib@) you could simply use all the original MIB files we store in the
     splunk-connect-for-snmp-mib-server project under the folder $ROOT_PROJECT/mibs/asn1. Something like this
     would work as well (assuming on extracted "splunk-connect-for-snmp-mib-server" project under
     ""$HOME/PycharmProjects/splunk-connect-for-snmp-mib-server").
     mibdump.py --mib-source "$HOME/PycharmProjects/splunk-connect-for-snmp-mib-server/mibs/asn1" \
                --mib-source . --destination-format pysnmp --destination-directory=./temp3 TintriMIB.txt

5. Copy <your-mib-file> to $ROOT_PROJECT/mibs/asn1
6. Copy all the .py files from the ./temp dir to $PROJECT_ROOT/mibs/pysnmp

Optional:
7. Add <your-mib-file> to tests/lookups/mibs_list.csv
8. Add a sample translation to test_translation.py::test_more_mib_files() and check that
   everything looks good.
