		"A table with redundancy status and control for

		The ports appearing in this table can be divided into
		two categories:
		Those with remote fault signaling capability and
		those without. The latter kind depends on the port
		link status to provide the required redundancy.

		Ports that are not capable of supporting redundancy do

		  swStandby(5)...the port is the standby companion
		                 in a software-redundant pair.

		The values that can be written, which change the
 		redundancy mode, are:
		  standalone(1)...causes the redundant pair to be
		                  broken up.
		  hwActive(2).....if the previous value was hwStandby(3),
		                  this value will cause the port to become
		                  the active port in the hardware-redundant
		                  pair, resulting in a switchover.
		  hwStandby(3)....if the previous value was hwActive(2),
		                  this value will cause the port to become
		                  the standby port in the hardware-redundant
		                  pair, resulting in a switchover.
		  swActive(4).....if the previous value was swStandby(5),
		                  this value will cause the port to become
		                  the active port in the software-redundant
		                  pair, resulting in a switchover.
		  swStandby(5)....if the previous value was swActive(4),
		                  this value will cause the port to become
		                  the standby port in the software-redundant
		                  pair, resulting in a switchover.

		To create a hardware-redundant pair, change this object
		to hwActive(2) or hwStandby(3).  To create a
		software-redundant pair, change this object to
		swActive(4) or swStandby(5).  The same SNMP SET PDU
