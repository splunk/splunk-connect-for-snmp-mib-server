	  -- The following describes some of the MIB-II interface
	  -- objects and their relationship with the objects in this
	  -- MIB extension.

	  -- ifDescr:  describes the interface.   It should include
	  -- identification information for the physical line and a
	  -- description of the network.  For connections to PDNs,
	  -- it should name the PDN.

	  -- ifMtu: the maximum number of octets an upper layer can
	  -- pass to this interface as a single frame.

	  -- ifSpeed:


	  -- ifAdminStatus:

	  -- ifOperStatus:

	  -- ifLastChange: the last time the state of the interface
	  -- changed.  A reset is considered an instantaneous change to
	  -- the ndm state and back to abm or abme.  This will be the
	  -- last time that lapbFlowChangeReason and lapbFlowChanges
	  -- changed.

	  -- ifInOctets: contains the number of octets
	  -- received from the peer LAPB including FCS.

	  -- ifInUcastPkts: contains the number of I-frames delivered
	  -- by this interface to a higher layer interface.

	  -- ifInDiscards: contains the number of received
	  -- frames discarded because of internal conditions
	  -- (such as lack of buffering).

	  -- ifInErrors: contains the number of Invalid frames received.
	  -- This does not have any relationship with the number REJ,
	  -- or RNR frames sent or received.

	  -- ifInUnknownProtos: contains the number of frames
	  -- that were correct but were dropped because they
	  -- were inappropriate for the current state.  This
	  -- includes an invalid Poll bit, an unknown address,
	  -- or other condition such as an RNR when connection
	  -- not established.  This also includes the number of
	  -- DISC or other frames that were ignored because the
	  -- link was not established and this interface was not
	  -- configured to perform link setup on that type frame.

	  -- ifOutOctets: number of octets sent to peer including
	  -- FCS octets.

	  -- ifOutUcastPkts: number of I-frames received from
	  -- a higher layer for transmission to peer.

	  -- ifOutDiscards: number of frames to be sent that were
	  -- dropped due to internal conditions such as buffering etc.

	  -- ifOutErrors: number of transmissions that failed
	  -- due to errors or were considered invalid by the receiver.
	  -- This does not have any relationship with the number REJ,
	  -- or RNR frames sent or received.


	  -- ifOutQLen: number of frames waiting to be transmitted.

	  -- This MIB does not provide any support for:
	  --      Multilink procedure (MLP) in ISO 7776 section 6
	  --      LLC Pbit timer
