                { comment:  
                This report definition has to be split to get one for 
                receiver and one for router.} 
                 
                Note:  
                An ippmHistoryValue is indexed using the owner, the 
                owner index, the metric index and the timestamp (e.g.: 
                acme.1.6.0106150820100100). So the metric index 
                identifies which metric result (One-way-Delay, Packet-
                Loss, Connectivity) the ippmHistoryValue carries."
