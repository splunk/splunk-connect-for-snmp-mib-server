         Referential integrity is necessary, i.e., the index needs to be
         persistent upon a reboot or restart of a device. The index
         is never to be reused for other PM sessions on the same MEP while this
         session is active, or until it wraps to zero. The index value keeps
         increasing up to that time. This is to facilitate access control based
         on a fixed index for an EMS, since the index is not reused.

         "This table contains the results for the current Measurement
          Interval in a SOAM Loss Measurement session gathered during the interval
          indicated by iterator counts.

          A row in this table is created automatically
          by the SNMP Agent when the Loss Measurement session is configured.

          Each row in the table represents the current statistics for a Loss
          Measurement session for the defined MEP. This table uses four indices.
          The first three indices are the indices of the Maintenance Domain, MaNet,
          and MEP tables. The fourth index is the specific LM session on the
          selected MEP. There may be more than one LM session per MEP. The
          main use case for this is to allow multiple CoS instances to be
          operating simultaneously for a MEP.

          The objects in this table apply regardless of the value of
          jnxSoamLmCfgType unless otherwise specified in the object description.

          Except for jnxSoamLmCurrentStatsIndex, jnxSoamLmCurrentStatsStartTime,

          each object in this table applies only if the corresponding bit is set in

          accessing the jnxSoamDmOperNextIndex object and using this value as
          the jnxSoamDmCfgIndex in the row creation.

          Some writable objects in this table are only applicable in certain cases
          (as described under each object), and attempts to write values for them
          in other cases will be ignored.

         "This table contains the results for the current Measurement
          Interval in a SOAM Delay Measurement session gathered during the interval
          indicated by iterator count.

          A row in this table is created automatically
          by the SNMP Agent when the Delay Measurement session is configured.

          Each row in the table represents the current statistics for a Delay
          Measurement session for the defined MEP. This table uses four indices.
          The first three indices are the indices of the Maintenance Domain, MaNet,
          and MEP tables. The fourth index is the specific DM session on the
          selected MEP. There can be more than one DM session per MEP.

          The objects in this table apply regardless of the value of
          jnxSoamDmCfgType unless otherwise specified in the object description.
          Backward and two-way statistic objects are undefined if jnxSoamDmCfgType 
          is dm1DmRx.

          Except for jnxSoamDmCurrentStatsIndex, jnxSoamDmCurrentStatsStartTime
          jnxSoamDmCurrentStatsElapsedTime and jnxSoamDmCurrentStatsSuspect,
          each object in this table applies only if the corresponding bit is set in
          jnxSoamDmCfgMeasurementEnable.

     DESCRIPTION
         "This table contains the results for history Measurement
          Intervals in a SOAM Delay Measurement session.

          Rows of this table are created automatically
          by the SNMP Agent when the Delay Measurement session is running and a
          Measurement Interval is completed.

          Each row in the table represents the Measurement Interval history
          statistics for a Delay Measurement session for the defined MEP. This
          table uses five indices. The first three indices are the indices of
          the Maintenance Domain, MaNet, and MEP tables. The fourth index is the
          specific DM session on the selected MEP. The fifth index is the
          Measurement Interval.

          At least 32 completed Measurement Intervals are to be supported. 96
          completed Measurement Intervals are recommended to be supported. If
          there are at least 32 rows in the table and a new Measurement Interval
          completes and a new row is to be added to the table, the oldest completed
          Measurement Interval can be deleted (row deletion). If the measurement
          interval is other than 15 minutes then a minimum of 8 hours of
          completed Measurement Intervals are to be supported and 24 hours are
          recommended to be supported.

          The objects in this table apply regardless of the value of
          jnxSoamDmCfgType unless otherwise specified in the object description.
          Backward and two-way statistic objects are undefined if jnxSoamDmCfgType 
          is dm1DmRx.

          Except for jnxSoamDmHistoryStatsIndex, jnxSoamDmHistoryStatsEndTime,
          jnxSoamDmHistoryStatsElapsedTime and jnxSoamDmHistoryStatsSuspect,
          each object in this table applies only if the corresponding bit is set in
          jnxSoamDmCfgMeasurementEnable.

          The rows and objects in this table are to be persistent upon reboot
          or restart of a device.

     MAX-ACCESS not-accessible

     DESCRIPTION
         "This table contains the list of Loss Measurement configuration threshold
          values for LM Performance Monitoring.
          The main purpose of the threshold configuration table is to configure
          threshold alarm notifications indicating that a specific performance
          metric is not being met.

          Each row in the table represents a Loss Measurement session threshold
          set for the defined MEP. This table uses five indices. The first three
          indices are the indices of the Maintenance Domain, MaNet, and MEP tables.
          The fourth index is the specific LM session on the selected MEP. The
          fifth index is the specific threshold set number.

          Rows in this table are not created automatically. A row is created in
          this table to set up a threshold set on a configured MEP that has a
          configured LM session.

          If two managers try to 'create' the same row at the same time, the first
          creation would succeed, the second creation attempt would result in an
          error. The second creation attempt would then need to select a new index
          value to successfully create a new row.

          An NE needs to support at least one threshold set for NE SOAM PM compliance. A
          second threshold set on the NE is desirable. More than two threshold
          sets can be configured on the NE if supported on the NE.

          All the objects in the row have a default value that disables the
          particular threshold measurement. In order to enable a threshold
          measurement the particular bit in the jnxSoamLmThresholdCfgEnable object
          is to be set to '1' and the selected threshold measurement is to have
          a threshold value configured. Non-configured threshold measurements
          are disabled by default.

          The writable objects in this table need to be persistent upon reboot
          or restart of a device.

     DESCRIPTION
         "This table contains the list of Delay Measurement threshold configuration
          values for DM Performance Monitoring.

          The main purpose of the threshold configuration table is to configure
          threshold alarm notifications indicating that a specific performance
          metric is not being met.

          Each row in the table represents a Delay Measurement session threshold
          set for the defined MEP. This table uses five indices. The first three
          indices are the indices of the Maintenance Domain, MaNet, and MEP tables.
          The fourth index is the specific DM session on the selected MEP. The
          fifth index is the specific threshold set number.

          Rows in this table are not created automatically. A row is created in
          this table to set up a threshold set on a configured MEP that has a
          configured DM session.

          An NE needs to support at least one threshold set for NE SOAM PM compliance. A
          second threshold set on the NE is desirable. More than two threshold
          sets on the NE can be configured if supported on the NE.

          All the objects in the row have a default value that disables the
          particular threshold measurement. In order to enable a threshold
          measurement the particular bit in the jnxSoamDmThresholdCfgEnable object
          is to be set to '1' and the selected threshold measurement is to have
          a threshold value configured. Non-configured threshold measurements
          are disabled by default.

          The writable objects in this table need to be persistent upon reboot
          or restart of a device.

		 and

		 b) the parameter threshold is configured in the jnxSoamLmThresholdCfgTable
		 or jnxSoamDmThresholdCfgTable; and

		 bPmThresholdAboveAlarm; and

		 e) no previous jnxSoamPmThresholdCrossingAlarm notifications with type
		 aboveAlarm have been sent relating to the same threshold in the
		 jnxSoamLmThresholdCfgTable or jnxSoamDmThresholdCfgTable and the
		 same parameter, during this Measurement Interval.

		 For a setAlarm five conditions need to be met:

		 a) measurement of the parameter is enabled via jnxSoamLmCfgMeasurementEnable
		 for a LM crossing or jnxSoamDmCfgMeasurementEnable for a DM crossing;
		 and

		 b) the parameter threshold is configured in the jnxSoamLmThresholdCfgTable

		 bPmThresholdSetClearAlarm for the Measurement Interval; and

		 e) the previous measured value did not

		 e) the previous measured value did
		 exceed the value configured in the jnxSoamLmThresholdCfgTable for
		 a LM crossing entry or jnxSoamDmThresholdCfgTable for a DM crossing
		 entry for a type of bPmThresholdSetClearAlarm.

		 In the case of thresholds applied to a maximum or average measurement
		 counter, the previous measured value is the value of the counter at the
		 end of the preceding Measurement Interval. In the case of thresholds
		 applied to the last measured value, it is the previous measured value.

		 The management entity that receives the notification can identify
		 the system from the network source address of the notification,

		 crossing by the indices in the jnxSoamPmNotificationCfgThresholdId object,
		 including dot1agCfmMdIndex, dot1agCfmMaIndex, dot1agCfmMepIdentifier,
		 and the jnxSoamLmCfgIndex or jnxSoamDmCfgIndex.

		 'notification-event' of a given type per LM or DM session as specified
		 by jnxSoamPmNotificationCfgAlarmInterval. A 'notification-event' is the
		 transmission of a single notification to a list of notification
		 destinations.

		 If additional threshold crossing events occur within the

		 period, one notification-event is generated if any threshold
