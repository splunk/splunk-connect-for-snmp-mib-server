-- Description 	: MIB for DHCP for Next Generation phoenix Switch.
-- 		: This MIB will be used in Windows and UNIX Environment.
--              : This could be made standard MIB file later by changing from 
--		: 'phoenix' to some standard name. This MIB is written keeping
--		: Client in the perspective. More Objects for Server can be 
--                : added and applied for IETF as a draft.

-- History :
--	 *    10-27-97 - Create.
--       *    02-04-98 - changed the timers from INTEGER to TimeTicks.

   MacAddress ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (6)) -- a 6 octet address
   BridgeId ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (8))   -- the
                                          -- Bridge-Identifier
                                          -- as used in the
                                          -- Spanning Tree
          -- Protocol to uniquely identify a bridge.  Its first two
          -- octets (in network byte order) contain a priority
          -- value and its last 6 octets contain the MAC address
          -- used to refer to a bridge in a unique fashion
          -- (typically, the numerically smallest MAC address
          -- of all ports on the bridge).

          -- Several objects in this MIB module represent values of
          -- timers used by the Spanning Tree Protocol.  In this
          -- MIB, these timers have values in units of hundreths of
          -- a second (i.e. 1/100 secs).
          -- These timers, when stored in a Spanning Tree Protocol's
          -- BPDU, are in units of 1/256 seconds.  Note, however,
          -- that 802.1D-1990 specifies a settable granularity of
          -- no more than 1 second for these timers.  To avoid
          -- ambiguity, a data type is defined here as a textual
          -- convention and all representation of these timers
          -- in this MIB module are defined using this data type.  An
          -- algorithm is also defined for converting between the
          -- different units, to ensure a timer's value is not
          -- distorted by multiple conversions.
          -- The data type is:

          Timeout ::= INTEGER -- a STP timer in units of 1/100 seconds

          -- To convert a Timeout value into a value in units of
          -- 1/256 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:
          --
          --      b  = floor( (n * 256) / 100)
          --
          -- where:
          --      floor   =  quotient [ignore remainder]
          --      n is the value in 1/100 second units
          --      b is the value in 1/256 second units
          --
          -- To convert the value from 1/256 second units back to
          -- 1/100 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:
          --
          --      n = ceiling( (b * 100) / 256)
          --
          -- where:
          --      ceiling =  quotient [if remainder is 0], or
          --                 quotient + 1 [if remainder is non-zero]
          --      n is the value in 1/100 second units
          --      b is the value in 1/256 second units
          --
          -- Note: it is important that the arithmetic operations are
          -- done in the order specified (i.e., multiply first, divide
          -- second).

            Current IP address of the client. To start with,it might be null  .
  	    This is filled by the server when sending a DHCPOFFER and

            Server Acks back this packet which is where Client/Server moves to 
            the Bound state. Once reached into Bound state, the client address
            is made the official address on the client.

            "
             When the client/server reaches the BOUND state, this is one of the
             parameters set by the server.

            Mentioned in RFC2131 4.4.5 as T1, this renewal time period in secs
            for the DHCP client is for using IP address on lease from the server
            Once the Reacquisition Timer period in secs afetr the lease period
            is reached, the client sends a DHCPREQUEST to the DHCP server reque-
            -sting for renewal of the lease.
            Default would be 50% of the Lease timer which is represeneted
            by the above object.  The client  moves from BOUND to RENEW state
            once the DHCPREQUEST is sent after time T1 secs is passed from the
            start of to release time. 
            T1 is always less than T2 ( see below for 'T2') which is  lesss than
            the lease Timer period.

            Mentioned in RFC2131 4.4.5 as T2,this Expiration time period in secs
            is the time period in secs during which DHCP has gone through the
            BOUND->RENEWAL state. After T1 secs and when the state machine 
            reaches T2 secs, ( T1 < T2 < lease period), DHCP client sends 
            another DHCPREQUEST to the server asking the server to renew the
            lease for the IP parameters.
            By default it would be 87.5% of the Lease timer .If there is DHCPACK
            then the DHCP client moves from REBIND to BOUND. Else it moves to 
            INIT state where it starts all over again sending a request for 
            DHCPDISCOVER.
