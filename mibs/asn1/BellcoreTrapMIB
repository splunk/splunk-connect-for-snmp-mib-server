          2.  Abstract

          This memo defines a private portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
          protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it
          defines an enterprise-specific trap, to be used in conjunction
          with other MIB modules.

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.

          3.  Historical Perspective

          As reported in RFC 1052, IAB Recommendations for the
          Development of Internet Network Management Standards [1], a
          two-prong strategy for network management of TCP/IP-based
          internets was undertaken.  In the short-term, the Simple
          Network Management Protocol (SNMP), defined in RFC 1067, was
          to be used to manage nodes in the Internet community.  In the
          long-term, the use of the OSI network management framework was
          to be examined.  Two documents were produced to define the
          management information: RFC 1065, which defined the Structure
          of Management Information (SMI), and RFC 1066, which defined
          the Management Information Base (MIB).  Both of these
          documents were designed so as to be compatible with both the
          SNMP and the OSI network management framework.

          The SMI has been amended by the extensions specified in
          RFC 1212 and RFC 1215 [9,10]. RFC1215 specifies a convention
          for defining traps for use with the SNMP.

          This memo defines an enterprise (Bellcore) specific trap.
          that can be used in conjunction with other MIB modules.

          4.  Objects

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) [7] defined in the SMI.  In particular, each
          object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an
          object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which
          specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
          object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
          instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
          use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also
          refer to the object type.

          The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
          language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI RFC 1155
          [3] purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be
          used.  These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.

          The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type
          is represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly
          tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is
          how the object type is represented when being transmitted on
          the network.  The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding
          rules of ASN.1 [8], subject to the additional requirements
          imposed by the SNMP.

          4.1.  Format of Definitions

          Section 6 contains contains the specification of all object
          types contained in this MIB module.  The object types are
          defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended
          by the extensions specified in RFC 1212 and RFC 1215 [9,10].

          Bellcore              fyiTrap Definition      December 9, 1993


          5.  Overview

          This MIB module defines a generic trap, the fyiTrap.  The
          significance of this trap depends on the context of its use
          and the VarBindList it conveys.

          The use of the fyiTrap, and the required VarBindList for a
          particular event is to be defined in Bellcore Requirements
          specifications. Specifications for which the use of this trap
          is considered include:

          --  TR-TSV-001062, SMDS CNM Service

          --  TA-NWT-001371, Frame Relay PVC CNM Service

          --  TA-NWT-001117, CNM Service for Exchange PVC Cell Relay
          Service

          --  TA-NWT-001237, SMDS XA-OM Service

          --  TA-NWT-001430, Frame Relay PVC XA-OM Service

          The use of this trap is encouraged for future specifications.
          Conversely, requests for registration of new Bellcore specific
          traps are discouraged.Contact the administrator of the
          {enterprises bellcore } OID branch for details.

          As an example, assume objects have been defined as follows:

                    petIndex OBJECT-TYPE
                        SYNTAX  INTEGER
                        ACCESS  not-accessible
                        STATUS  mandatory
                        DESCRIPTION
                                "A unique value for each pet."
                          ::= { petOID 1 }

                    petStatus OBJECT-TYPE
                        SYNTAX  INTEGER {
                             other (1),
                             hungry (2)
                        }
                        ACCESS  read-only
                        STATUS  mandatory
                        DESCRIPTION

          Bellcore              fyiTrap Definition      December 9, 1993


                                "The object identifies whether the pet
                                is hungry."
                          ::= { petOID 2 }


          The fyiTrap can be generated to flag a change in the value of
          petStatus. Requirements specifications should specify the
          circumstances when a fyiTrap must be generated, and should
          also specify the relevant VarBind list of the fyiTrap. For
          example:

          (R)  Upon petStatus assuming the value of hungry(2), a
               fyiTrap shall be generated with the following VarBinds:
                  petIndex
                  petStatus
               Upon petStatus assuming the value other(1), no
               fyiTrap shall be generated.
