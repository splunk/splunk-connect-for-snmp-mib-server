       DESCRIPTION
               "This textual convention is an extension of the
               InterfaceIndex convention.  The latter defines a
               greater than zero value used to identify an interface
               or interface sub-layer in the managed system.  This
               extension permits the additional value of zero.  the
               value zero is object-specific and must therefore be
               defined as part of the description of any object which
               uses this syntax.  Examples of the usage of zero might
               include situations where interface was unknown, or
               when none or all interfaces need to be referenced."
