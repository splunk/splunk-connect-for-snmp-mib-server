        "Number of buffer overflows. This records the count of the
         number of times the CES reassembly buffer overflows. If the CES
         IWF is implemented with multiple buffers (such as a cell level
         buffer and a bit level buffer, then either buffer overflow will
         cause this count to be incremented "
