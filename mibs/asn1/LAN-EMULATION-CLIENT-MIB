                        "A combination flag and ifTable index, indicating
                         whether a LAN Emulation circuit exists - and, if
                         so, which interface is associated with it at the
                         point where it connects to a LE Client.

                         Objects of this type are always defined as part of
                         a set that includes

                                 fooInterface   LeConnectionInterface
                                 fooVpi         VpiInteger
                                 fooVci         VciInteger

                         The interpretation of these objects is as follows.

                         1.  If no connection exists, 'fooInterface' has a
                             value of 0.  Because Interfaces table entries
                             always have 'ifIndex' values larger than 0,
                             'fooInterface' reliably serves as a 'connection
                             exists' flag.

                             In this case, 'fooVpi' and 'fooVci' are
                             meaningless, and have the value 0.

                         2.  If a PVC or SVC exists, 'fooInterface' is defined
                             to have the value of the MIB-II/RFC 1573 'ifIndex'
                             of the 'atm' interface associated with the VCC.
                             'fooVpi' and 'fooVci' will contain its VPI/VCI.
                             Therefore, ('fooInterface', 'fooVpi', 'fooVci')
                             give you an index into the AToM MIB which allows
                             you to examine and play with the circuit further.

                          3. If a proprietary connection (such as an internal
                             data path between co-located components) exists,
                             this specification does not mandate how it should
                             be managed.  One option is to set 'fooInterface'
                             to the value of the MIB-II/RFC 1573 'ifIndex' for
                             the LAN Emulation Client.  This indicates that a
                             connection exists, but is not being managed in the
                             same fashion as an ATM VCC."

                MAX-ACCESS   not-accessible
                STATUS       current
                DESCRIPTION
                        "A table describing all of the LAN Emulation Clients
                         implemented by this host.  Each LE Client has a row
                         in the MIB-II/RFC 1573 Interfaces table (describing
                         the emulated packet interface it presents to higher
                         layers).  Each LE Client also has a row in this and
                         other LEC MIB tables (describing its interface with
                         other LAN Emulation components).

                         This table contains configuration variables.  Three
                         extension tables contain client status, performance
                         statistics, and information about control/multicast
                         VCCs.

                         Unlike hardware ports, LE Clients can be created by
                         management.  However, the RFC 1573 Interfaces table
                         does not directly support row creation.  Therefore,
                         creating or deleting a row in the lecConfigTable is
                         defined to have the side effect of creating or
                         deleting corresponding rows in

                             -  the MIB-II / RFC 1573 Interfaces table,
                             -  the 'lecMappingTable',
                             -  the 'lecStatusTable',
                             -  the 'lecServerVccTable',
                             -  the 'lecStatisticsTable', and
                             -  any other dependent tables

                         New Interfaces table rows for LAN Emulation Clients
                         always have 'ifAdminStatus' set to 'down'.


                         A Note On Indexing:
                         -------------------
                         Most of the tables in this MIB are indexed in whole
                         or in part by 'lecIndex' - not by 'ifIndex'.

                         Why is there a separate index?

                         Traditionally, ifIndex values are chosen by agents,
                         and are permitted to change across restarts.  Using
                         ifIndex to index lecConfigTable could complicate
                         row creation and/or cause interoperability problems
                         (if each agent had special restrictions on ifIndex).
                         Having a separate index avoids these problems.      "

                                 which support ATM LAN Emulation Clients.

                For a host to conform to this MIB, it must also implement

                  - RFC 1213 - MIB II.

                  - Interfaces table entries for each LE Client, as per the
                    LAN Emulation Client management specification.

                  - The AToM MIB (RFC 1695 - Definitions of Managed Objects
                    for ATM Management), according to the conformance
                    statements defined in that RFC.

                Optionally, a host may implement

                  - RFC 1573 - Evolution of the Interfaces Group of MIB-II.

                  - The 'ifRcvAddressGroup' from RFC 1573, which provides a
                    way to represent and configure interfaces with multiple
                    addresses.

                See the LAN Emulation Client management specification for
                interpretations of RFC 1573 / MIB-II as they apply to LAN
                Emulation Clients."
