    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module defines textual conventions used by MIB
        modules defining objects describing IP address pools."
    REVISION        "201002020000Z"
    DESCRIPTION
        "The initial version of the MIB module."
    ::= { ciscoMgmt 742 }



IpAddrPoolInstanceIdentifier ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT    "d"
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "An arbitrary integer-value that uniquely identifies a row in a
        table defined by a MIB module defining objects describing data
        relating to IP address pool."
    SYNTAX          Unsigned32 (1..4294967295)

IpAddrPoolInstanceIdentifierOrZero ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT    "d"
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention serves as an extension of the
        IpAddressPoolIdentifier textual convention, which permits the
        value '0'.  The use of the value '0' is specific to an object,
        thus requiring the descriptive text associated with the object
        to describe the semantics of its use."
    SYNTAX          Unsigned32 (0..4294967295)

IpAddressPoolName ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT    "255a"
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A string-value that denotes the name assigned to an IP address
        pool.  The semantics of the string-value are the same as those
        specified by the SnmpAdminString textual convention defined by
        the SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB [RFC3411]."

IpAddressPoolNameOrNull ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT    "255a"
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention serves as an extension of the
        IpAddressPoolName textual convention, which permits the null
        string.  The use of the null string is specific to an object,
        thus requiring the descriptive text associated with the object
        to describe the semantics of its use."
    SYNTAX          OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..255))

IpAddressPoolGroupName ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT    "255a"
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A string-value that denotes the name assigned to an IP address
        pool group.  The semantics of the string-value are the same as
        those specified by the SnmpAdminString textual convention
        defined by the SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB [RFC3411]."

IpAddressPoolGroupNameOrNull ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT    "255a"
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention serves as an extension of the
        IpAddressPoolGroupName textual convention, which permits the
        null string.  The use of the null string is specific to an
        object, thus requiring the descriptive text associated with the
        object to describe the semantics of the its use."
    SYNTAX          OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..255))

IpAddressPoolThresholdUnits ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "An enumerated integer-value that denotes the units used when
        specifying an IP address pool threshold:

            'other'
                The implementation of the MIB module using this textual
                convention does not recognize the IP address pool
                threshold units.

            'absolute'
                The value of the corresponding IP address pool threshold
                is an absolute number of IP addresses or IP prefixes,
                depending on the context.

            'percent'
                The value of the corresponding IP address pool threshold
                is a percentage of the total number of free and in-use
                IP addresses or IP prefixes contained by a pool."
    SYNTAX          INTEGER  {
                        other(1),
