		OBJECTS { pnCommonEventDescr }
		STATUS  current
		DESCRIPTION
			"A possible mismatch was detected between the duplex setting
			of either the local or remote interface and that of the
			device attached to that interface. The interface (local
			or remote) is identified by the 'pnCommonEventDescr' object.

			Note that this notification is quite different from
			pnCommonEventInterfaceSpeedMismatch, which compares the
			local and remote interfaces on the same Peribit device."
