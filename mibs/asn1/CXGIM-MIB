successive failed attempts.

Options:
noFailure (1): Once a system route has been successfully connected, this 
value is maintained for the duration of the connection.

internalError (2): An internal error has occurred.

localAllocFailure (3): There is insufficient memory available for X25 
Convergence to establish this connection.

remoteAllocFailure (4): There is insufficient memory available for the 
destination protocol layer to establish this connection.

localNoAccess (5): This route is associated with a SAP that does not 
exist.

remoteNoAccess (6): This route is associated with a SAP that does not 
exist at the destination layer.

localPvcDown (7): For future use.

remotePvcDown (8): The PVC at the destination protocol layer is down.

localPvcBusy (9): The SAP associated with this route is already connected.

remotePvcBusy (10): The destination associated with this route is already 
connected. This typically occurs when the route is a non-MPE (PVC 
consolidating) circuit.

localFcnFailure (11): Flow control negotiation failed.

remoteFcnFailure (12): Flow control negotiation failed at the destination 
protocol layer.

localDsnFailure (13): Data size negotiation failed.

localRefInUse (14): Data size negotiation failed at the destination 
protocol layer.

remoteAliasNotFound (15): The destination alias (gimSRDestAlias) does 
not exist.

remoteNoPvcService (16): The destination protocol layer does not support 
PVC service.

mpeInvalidSubref (17): The value of gimSRSubRef is invalid at the 
destination protocol layer. (i.e., lapcnvSRSubRef is set to '0' and the 
destination frame relay circuit is configured for PVC consolidation)."
