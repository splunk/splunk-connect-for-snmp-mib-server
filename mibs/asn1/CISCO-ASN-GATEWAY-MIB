    DESCRIPTION
        "This module manages Cisco's WiMAX ASN Gateway (ASN-GW).
        A WiMAX network supports wireless data communication through
        WiMAX radio (802.16) technology. 

        The high level architecture of a first generation WiMAX network
        with the respective protocols for each interface is shown below:

           |                                                        |
           +--------------------------------------------------------+

        The diagram below depicts the relation of the subscriber to the
        session and flows:

        +--------+                       -Flow (connected via data path)
        | ASN-GW | - Subscriber -Session -Flow (connected via data path)
        +--------+                  |    -Flow (connected via data path)
                                    |    -Flow (connected via data path)
                                    |
                                    +--- (connected via signaling path)

        A subscriber initiates a call from a MS. A session is created
        between the BS and the ASN-GW for that call. Multiple flows can
        be created for the session with different QOS parameters. For
        example one flow can created for a voice stream and another
        for data. Data paths are created between the BS and ASN-GW to
        forward the data packets of the created flows.
        When the first subscriber from any MS connected to a BS
        initiates a call via the BS to the ASN-GW, a signaling path is
        created between the BS and the ASN-GW. There is only one 
        signaling path between each BS and ASN-GW. Signaling paths 
        and base stations can be used interchangeably.

        The signaling and data paths remains active as long as there are
        subscribers connected to the ASN-GW from any MS connected to the
        BS. If a path has no session/flow connected, it will be purged
        after a certain period of time. This situation can occur when
        all subscribers on a certain path are disconnected. A subscriber
        disconnecting from a certain path does not indicate that the
        subscriber has left the network, it could simply be handing off
        to a different path. 

        The IP addresses of the signaling and data paths can be the same
        or different both in the BS side and in the ASN-GW side.

                            protocols procedures for authentications, 
                            authorizatitin and accounting associated

         AGW                ASN-GW

         ASN                ASN (Access Service network) is defined as  
                            a complete set of network functions needed
                            to provide radio access to a WiMAX 
                            subscriber.

         ASN-GW             ASN-Gateway is a logical entity that 
                            represents an aggregation of Control Plane 
                            functional entities that are either paired 
                            with a corresponding function in the ASN 
                            (for e.g BS instance) a resident function is
                            the CSN or another functions in the ASN.
                            For every MS, a BS is associated with 
                            exactly one default ASN-GW. However,
                            ASN-GW functions for every MS may be 
                            distributes amongst multiple
                            ASN-GWs located in one or more ASNs. The
                            ASN-GW utilizes Session Redudancy to ensure
                            a backup ASN-GW is available in case the
                            primary ASN-GW goes down.

         BS                 Base Station is a logical entity that 
                            represents an aggregation of Control Plane 
                            functional entities that are either paired 
                            with a corresponding function in the ASN
                            (e.g. BS instance), a resident function
                            in the CSN or a function in another ASN. The
                            ASN-GW may also perform Bearer Plane routing
                            or bridging function.

         BSID               The Base Station Identifier is a global
                            unique identifier for a WiMAX base station.

         CSN                CSN (Connectivity Service Network) is 
                            defined as a set of network functions that 
                            provide IP connectivity services to the 
                            WiMAX subscribers. 

         Data Path          Corresponding to each subscriber, data paths
                            are created to foward packets between the 
                            ASN-GW and the subscribers.

         DPID               Data Path ID is used to identify the tunnel
                            carrying MS traffic between ASN gateways or
                            between the ASN gateway and base station.
                            As of 8/28/07, only the GRE key is to be
                            used as the DPID.

         Flow               A service flow is a unidirectional logical
                            flow between the network and the Subscriber
                            Station. A service flow is created to handle
                            a different QoS over the connection oriented
                            MAC. A subscriber can have multiple service
                            flows associated and each service flow is
                            associcated with an uplink and downlink
                            classifier.

         MS                 The Mobile Station is a generalized mobile 
                            equipment set providing connectivity between
                            subscriber equipment and a base station (BS)
                            The Mobile Station may be a host or a CPE 
                            type of device that can support multiple 
                            hosts.

         MSID               The Mobile Station Identifier is the 802.16 
                            identifier used for all subscriber stations,
                            and is used in all the messages over R6. The
                            identifier associates all requests from a 
                            mobile to the ASN-GW.

         Packets            Packets are datagrams fowarded over the data
                            paths.

         R1                 Communication protocol between mobile and BS
                            as per the air interface (PHY and MAC)
                            specifications (IEEE P802.16d/e). R1 may
                            include additional protocols related to the
                            management plane.

         R2                 The interface between the MS and CSN 
                            associated with Authentication, 
                            Services Authorization, IP Host 
                            Configuration management, and mobility
                            management. This is a logical interface thus
                            does not reflect a direct protocol interface
                            between MS and CSN.

         R3                 The interface between the ASN and the CSN to
                            support AAA, policy enforcement and mobility
                            management capabilities. It also encompasses
                            the bearer plane methods (e.g., tunneling)
                            to transfer IP data between the ASN and the
                            CSN.

         R4                 Communication protocol between ASN-GWs.
                            R4 consists of a set of control and bearer
                            plane protocols originating/terminating in
                            various entities within the ASN that 
                            coordinate MS mobility between ASNs. 
                            In Release 1, R4 is the only interoperable 
                            interface between
                            heterogeneous or dissimilar ASNs.

         R5                 Consists of a set of control plane and 
                            bearer plane protocols for internetworking 
                            between CSNs operated by either the home or
                            visited NSP.

         R6                 Communication protocol between ASN-GW and BS
                            R6 consists of a set of control and bearer
                            plane protocols for communication between 
                            the BS and the ASN GW.
                            The bearer plane consists of intra-ASN 
                            data path or inter-ASN tunnels between the
                            BS and ASN-GW.
                            The control plane includes protocols for
                            IP tunnel management (establish, modify, and
                            release) in accordance with the MS mobility
                            events. R6 may also serve as a conduit for
                            exchange of MAC states information between
                            neighboring BSs.

         R8                 Communication protocol between base 
                            stations.
                            R8 consists of a set of control plane 
                            message flows and, in some situations, 
                            bearer plane data flows between the 
                            base stations to ensure fast and seamless
                            handover.
                            Bearer plane consists of protocols that 
                            allow the data transfer between Base 
                            Stations involved in handover of a 
                            certain MS.
                            Control plane consists of the inter-BS 
                            communication protocol defined in IEEE 
                            802.16 and additional set of protocols 
                            that allow controlling the data
                            transfer between the Base Stations involved
                            in handover of a certain MS.

         Session            Session is a connection between one or more
                            MS and a network element in order to
                            exchange link-level frames or packets. 

         SFID               The service flow is identified using a SFID
                            (Service Flow Identifier). 

         Signaling Path     A signaling path exists between the BS and
                            ASN-GW, and is used for all signaling such 
                            as creating, dleteing, authenticating, 
                            as we as additional functions related to 
                            the subscriber.
