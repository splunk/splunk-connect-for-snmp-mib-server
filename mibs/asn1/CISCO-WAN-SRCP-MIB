    DESCRIPTION
            "The MIB module for managing SRCP(Simple Resource
             Coordination Protocol) implementations. SRCP
             is a resource coordination protocol used
             between a MGC(Media Gateway Controller) and
             a MG(Media Gateway). SRCP MIB is applicable
             to both controllers (SRCP clients) and gateways
             (SRCP servers).
             
             MGMIB: This is the short name used for 
                    CISCO-WAN-MG-MIB in this MIB."

        Entries in this table are implicitly created by the agent. 

        If the agent supports MGMIB, this occurs as follows:

        mgcRedundancyGrpProtocolTable(defined in
        CISCO-WAN-MGC-REDUN-MIB MIB) and when

        that MGC Redundancy Group. Accordingly, an entry
        shall be deleted if the corresponding entry in
        the mgcRedundancyGrpProtocolTable is deleted.

        If the agent does not support MGMIB, entry creation
        might occur when the first SRCP communication with
        an IP address/domain  name occurs.

        if MGC Redundacy feature is supported the following objects:
        srcpPeerHeartbeatInterval, srcpPeerTimeSinceHeartbeat
        rcpPeerMaxPduSize are not meaningful here. These objects
