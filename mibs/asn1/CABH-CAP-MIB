            "The Primary Packet-handling Mode of the Portal Services
            logical element (PS) of a CableHome compliant residential
            gateway device. This object configures operation of the PS
            packet handling functions.

            When the value of this object is napt(1), the PS is
            required to support the Network Address and Port
            Translation (NAPT) process in accordance with the NAPT
            requirements defined in IETF RFC 3022. When operating in
            NAPT Primary Packet Handling Mode, the PS supports the
            translation of multiple LAN-Trans IP addresses and their
            TCP/UDP ports into a single WAN-Data IP address and its 
            TCP/UDP ports.

            When the value of this object is nat(2), the PS is required
            to support the Network Address Translation (NAT) process in
            accordance with the NAT equirements defined in IETF RFC
            3022. When operating in NAT Primary Packet Handling Mode,
            the PS supports the translation of multiple LAN-Trans IP
            addresses into the same number of unique WAN-Data IP
            addresses.

            When the value of this object is passthrough(3), the PS is
            required to act as a transparent bridge in accordance with
            IEEE 802.1D. When operating in Passthrough Primary Packet
            Handling Mode, the PS does not translate network addresses,
            and bridges all traffic between its LAN and WAN interfaces.

            The PS MUST delete dynamically-created row entries from
            the cabhCapMappingTable, i.e. those with
            cabhCapMappingMethod = dynamic(2), when the value of
            cabhCapPrimaryMode changes. The PS MUST NOT delete
            statically-created row entries from the cabhCapMappingTable
            where cabhCapMappingMethod = static(1), when the value of
            cabhCapPrimaryMode changes."
