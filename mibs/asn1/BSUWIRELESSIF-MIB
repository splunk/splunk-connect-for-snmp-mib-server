	    getting the complete results, the SNMP Manager tool should increase
	    it's timeout value for this object to more than 10 seconds.

	DESCRIPTION
	   "This flag is used to modify and commit the changes of the dependent 
	    parameters from this group: 
	    aniBsuWirelessIfConfTargetFrequency
	    aniBsuWirelessFreqAdminTable

	    Setting this object to true(1) causes the agent to validate
	    the entire set of parameters. If these set of values are 
	    acceptable, then the new values are changed on the device.
	    However, for the changes to take effect, it is required to upload
	    the configuration (set aniDevControlStartUpload in the device_control.mib
	    to true) and then reboot the device.

	    If the validation fails when aniBsuWirelessIfConfModify is set 
	    to true(1), the changes are not commited and an error is returned.
	    In that case, the modified parameters in this group may not
	    reflect the correct values. They will display the values last
	    configured by the user, rather than the current values on the device.
	    To view the current values for
	    aniBsuWirelessIfConfTargetFrequency refer to aniBsuTargetFrequency
	    aniBsuWirelessFreqAdminTable refer to aniBsuWirelessFreqOperTable

	    A Get request on this object will always return false(2).
