          Repetitive Patterns

        allZero(1): All Zeroes(Continuous spaces).  This is 
                repeating pattern of zeros(...000...). 
                The use of this pattern is to test and verify 
                that the ones density policing mechanism is 
                functioning properly.  This pattern must be 
                used in circuits optioned for B8ZS.

        allOnes(2): All Ones(Continuous Marks).  This is repeating
                pattern of ones(...1111...).  This provides 
                testing of maximum power level requirements.
                The all one pattern test causes the repeater 
                to consume the maximum amount of power. 
                If there is insufficient DC span power then the
                repeater may begin to fail.
                Typically this pattern is used for a simple
                continuity check.  It may also be used to detect
                the presence of unwanted loop in the network.

        alternateOneZero(3): Alternate one/zero pattern(..1010..).  This
                pattern produces a 50% ones density.  It is
                used to stress the repeater's DC power
                consumption.

        doubleOneZero(4): Double alternate one/zero(..1100..).

         userThreeWords(7),
         userFourWords(8),

           This is the 2^15-1(32767 bit length)
           pattern as specified in ITU O.151.
           It has the maximum of 15(inverted) sequential zeros.
           This sequence is primarily intended for
           error and jitter measurements at bit
