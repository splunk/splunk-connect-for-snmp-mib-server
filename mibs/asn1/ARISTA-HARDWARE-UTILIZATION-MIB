    DESCRIPTION
            "This MIB contains information about the capacity and
            utilization of hardware resources on Arista devices.

            Arista ships and supports devices which perform packet
            forwarding decisions in hardware. To make these forwarding
            decisions (L2 bridging, input and output access list, L3
            forwarding based on IP destination etc.), the devices use
            information programmed in various hardware
            resources. Examples of such hardware resources are the
            hash table used for MAC address lookup, TCAM for
            destination IP lookup etc. 

            Each of Arista's devices have different hardware resource
            capacity or size limits. It is extremely useful for a
            Network Management system to be able to query and monitor
            the utilization of these hardware resources. Due to
            unxpected network event or configuration change, it is
            possible that a specific hardware resource is over
            utilized and there is no room to program additional
            entries. For example, a routing mis-configuration can
            result in overflowing the L3 forwarding TCAM. This may
            be detrimental to the network operation. So it's extremely
            useful to monitor the utilization of the various hardware
            resources of a specific device.

            On some devices, due to hardware design considerations,
            several features may have to share a single hardware
            resource. If one feature ends up using more of the same
            resource, it can affect the functionality of another
            feature. This is another reason to have visibility into
            the hardware resource usage.

            The hardware element that makes the forwarding decision is
            frequently referred to as the 'Forwarding ASIC' or
            'Forwarding Chip'. In this MIB document we refer to this
            hardware element as 'Forwarding Element'. Even though a
            device can have multiple forwarding elements, the information
            programmed in each of the forwarding element is typically
            the same. But there are some cases, where this is not the
            case. In such instances, the utilization of relevant
            hardware resource(s) may not be the same across all the
            forwarding elements.

            This MIB module provides the hardware capacity and
            utilization information for various resources in a generic
            manner, that's applicable to all Arista devices."

        "A single conceptual row containing utilization information
        for a specific hardware resource.

        There are many hardware resources on Arista devices. Each
        resource is identified by a name. Several 'features' can be
        using the same hardware resource. Every feature is identified
        by a name. On several platforms, we have more than one
        forwarding elements which is identified by a name.

        A single conceptual row in the hardware utilization table
        represents utilization of a specific hardware resource by a
        specific feature on the specified forwarding element.

        Note that it is possible to have an entry where feature and
        forwarding element are both empty strings. In these cases, the
        conceptual row describes the overall utilization for the
        particular hardware resource."

        entries that can be allocated for the given hardware resource
        by the specific feature (assuming it is not being shared with
        any other feature).

        Even though the raw number of maximum entries is fixed for a
        given hardware resource, the logical entries available to a
        specific feature may vary. 

        An example: Consider a device where the width ('number of
        bits') of a single TCAM entry is 128. It is possible to store an
        IPv4 access control list (matching both source and destination
        addresses) using a single entry of this TCAM. But given that
        IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long, 2 TCAM entries will be
        required to store an equivalent IPv6 access control list.

        In this example above, the 'maximum number of entries'
        available for the IPv4 feature is twice the number for
        the IPv6 feature."
