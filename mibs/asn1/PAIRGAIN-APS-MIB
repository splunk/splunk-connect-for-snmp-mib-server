--  NOTE:  This is a linear APS 1+1 MIB, thus it assumes that the APS group
--  consists of two channels (the working channel and the protection channel).
--  It does not support the 1:n protection scheme.
--  A standard IETF MIB did not exist at the time of writing this MIB, so we generated
--  this proprietary MIB.
--
--
--  Some object definitions were taken from an early draft of the IETF MIB
--  standard to allow for future migration to the standard when it does get accepted.

       DESCRIPTION
       "This Textual Convention describes the K1K2 overhead
	   bytes in the SONET frame that controls APS.

	   K1 is located in the low order byte, K2 is located in
       the higher order second byte.

       Bits 1-4 of the K1 byte indicate a request.

       1111  Lockout of Protection
       1110  Forced Switch
       1101  SF - High Priority
       1100  SF - Low Priority
       1011  SD - High Priority
       1010  SD - Low Priority

       0010  Reverse Request
       0001  Do Not Revert
       0000  No Request

       Bits 5-8 of the K1 byte indicate the channel associated with the
       request defined in bits 1-4.

       0000 is the Null channel

       1-14 are working channels.
       15   is the extra traffic channel

       Bits 1-4 of the K2 byte indicate a channel. The channel is
       defined with the same syntax as K1 Bits 5-8.

       Bit 5 of the K2 byte indicates the type of
       architecture.

       0 means the architecture is 1+1
       1 means the architecture is 1:n

       Bits 6-8 of the K2 byte indicates the
       mode.

       000 - 011 are reserved for future use

       100  indicates the mode is unidirectional
       101  indicates the mode is bidirectional
