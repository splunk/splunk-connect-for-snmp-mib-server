DESCRIPTION
    "The MIB module for managing the new Ethernet OAM features
    introduced by the Ethernet in the First Mile task force (IEEE
    802.3ah).  The functionality presented here is based on IEEE
    802.3ah [802.3ah], released in October, 2004.  [802.3ah] was
    prepared as an addendum to the standing version of IEEE 802.3
    [802.3-2002] at the time.  Since then, [802.3ah] has been
    merged into the base IEEE 802.3 specification in [802.3-2005].
   
    In particular, this MIB focuses on the new OAM functions
    introduced in Clause 57 of [802.3ah].  The OAM functionality
    of Clause 57 is controlled by new management attributes
    introduced in Clause 30 of [802.3ah].  The OAM functions are
    not specific to any particular Ethernet physical layer, and
    can be generically applied to any Ethernet interface of
    [802.3-2002].  
   
    An Ethernet OAM protocol data unit is a valid Ethernet frame
    with a destination MAC address equal to the reserved MAC
    address for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [802.3ah]), a
    lengthOrType field equal to the reserved type for Slow
    Protocols, and a Slow Protocols subtype equal to that of the
    subtype reserved for Ethernet OAM.  OAMPDU is used throughout
    this document as an abbreviation for Ethernet OAM protocol
    data unit.  
   
    The following reference is used throughout this MIB module:

  MAX-ACCESS  read-only
  STATUS      current
  DESCRIPTION 
    "At initialization and failure conditions, two OAM entities on
    the same full-duplex Ethernet link begin a discovery phase to
    determine what OAM capabilities may be used on that link.  The
    progress of this initialization is controlled by the OAM
    sublayer.  
               
    This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on this
    interface via the cdot3OamAdminState.  

    If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAMPDUs
    with a link fault indication, the value is linkFault(2). Also,
    if the interface is not operational (ifOperStatus is not 
    up(1)), linkFault(2) is returned.  Note that the object 
    ifOperStatus may not be up(1) as a result of link failure or
    administrative action (ifAdminState being down(2) or
    testing(3)).  
                     
    The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in
    passive mode (cdot3OamMode) and reflects the state in which the
    OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer device is OAM
    capable.  The activeSendLocal(4) value is used by active mode
    devices (cdot3OamMode) and reflects the OAM entity actively
    trying to discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has
    not yet made that determination.  
                     
    The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OAM
    entity has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or
    rejected the configuration of the peer.  The local device can,
    for whatever reason, decide that the peer device is
    unacceptable and decline OAM peering.  If the local OAM entity
    rejects the peer OAM entity, the state becomes
    oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7).  If the OAM peering is allowed
    by the local device, the state moves to
    sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6).  Note that both the
    sendLocalAndRemote(5) and oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7) states
    fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE of the Discovery state
    diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being
    whether the local OAM client has actively rejected the peering
    or has just not indicated any decision yet.  Whether a peering
    decision has been made is indicated via the local flags field
    in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of
    30.3.6.1.10).  

    If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state
    becomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8).  Note that both the
    sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6) and oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8)
    states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE_OK of the
    Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the
    difference being whether the remote OAM client has rejected
    the peering or has just not yet decided.  This is indicated
    via the remote flags field in the OAM PDU (reflected in the
    aOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11).  
                     
    When the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote
    OAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to
    operational(9) corresponding to the SEND_ANY state of the
    Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5].  

    Since Ethernet OAM functions are not designed to work
    completely over half-duplex interfaces, the value
    nonOperHalfDuplex(10) is returned whenever Ethernet OAM is
    enabled (cdot3OamAdminState is enabled(1)) but the interface is
    in half-duplex operation.

  STATUS      current
  DESCRIPTION 
    "This object configures the mode of OAM operation for this
    Ethernet like interface.  OAM on Ethernet interfaces may be in
    'active' mode or 'passive' mode.  These two modes differ in
    that active mode provides additional capabilities to initiate
    monitoring activities with the remote OAM peer entity, while
    passive mode generally waits for the peer to initiate OAM
    actions with it.  As an example, an active OAM entity can put
    the remote OAM entity in a loopback state, where a passive OAM
    entity cannot.  

    The default value of cdot3OamMode is dependent on the type of
    system on which this Ethernet like interface resides.  The
    default value should be 'active(1)' unless it is known that
    this system should take on a subservient role to the other
    device connected over this interface.  

    Changing this value results in incrementing the configuration
    revision field of locally generated OAMPDUs (30.3.6.1.12) and
    potentially re-doing the OAM discovery process if the
    cdot3OamOperStatus was already operational(9).

    "The OAM functions supported on this Ethernet like interface.
    OAM consists of separate functionality sets above the basic
    discovery process.  This value indicates the capabilities of
    the peer OAM entity with respect to these functions.  This
    value is initialized so all bits are clear. 

    If unidirectionalSupport(0) is set, then the peer OAM entity
    supports sending OAM frames on Ethernet interfaces when the
    receive path is known to be inoperable.   If
    loopbackSupport(1) is set, then the peer OAM entity can send
    and receive OAM loopback commands.  If eventSupport(2) is set,
    then the peer OAM entity can send and receive event OAMPDUs to
    signal various error conditions. If variableSupport(3) is set,
    then the peer OAM entity can send and receive variable
    requests to monitor attribute value as described in Clause 57
    of [802.3ah].   

    The capabilities of the OAM peer can be determined from the
    configuration field of the Local Information TLV of the most
    recently received Information OAMPDU with a Local Information
    TLV.  All zeros are returned if no Local Information TLV has
    yet been received.

    cdot3OamFunctionsSupported includes the loopbackSupport bit

    Loopback can be used to place the remote OAM entity in a state
    where every received frame (except OAMPDUs) is echoed back
    over the same interface on which they were received.   In this
    state, at the remote entity, 'normal' traffic is disabled as
    only the looped back frames are transmitted on the interface.
    Loopback is thus an intrusive operation that prohibits normal
    data flow and should be used accordingly.  "

  STATUS      current 
  DESCRIPTION 
    "The loopback status of the OAM entity.  This status is
    determined by a combination of the local parser and
    multiplexer states, the remote parser and multiplexer states,
    as well as by the actions of the local OAM client.  When
    operating in normal mode with no loopback in progress, the
    status reads noLoopback(1).  

    The values initiatingLooopback(2) and terminatingLoopback(4)
    can be read or written.  The other values can only be read -
    they can never be written.  Writing initiatingLoopback causes
    the local OAM entity to start the loopback process with its
    peer.  This value can only be written when the status is
    noLoopback(1).  Writing the value initiatingLoopback(2) in any
    other state has no effect.  When in remoteLoopback(3), writing
    terminatingLoopback(4) causes the local OAM entity to initiate
    the termination of the loopback state.  Writing
    terminatingLoopack(4) in any other state has no effect.                    
    If the OAM client initiates a looopback and has sent an
    Loopback OAMPDU and is waiting for a response, where the local
    parser and multiplexer states are DISCARD (see [802.3ah,
    57.2.11.1]), the status is 'initiatingLoopback'.  In this
    case, the local OAM entity has yet to receive any
    acknowledgement that the remote OAM entity has received its
    loopback command request.  
                    
    If the local OAM client knows that the remote OAM entity is in
    loopback mode (via the remote state information as described
    in [802.3ah, 57.2.11.1, 30.3.6.1.15]), the status is
    remoteLoopback(3).  If the local OAM client is in the process
    of terminating the remote loopback [802.3ah, 57.2.11.3,
    30.3.6.1.14], with its local multiplexer and parser states in
    DISCARD, the status is terminatingLoopback(4).  If the remote
    OAM client has put the local OAM entity in loopback mode as
    indicated by its local parser state, the status is
    localLoopback(5).  

    The unknown(6) status indicates the parser and multiplexer
    combination is unexpected.  This status may be returned if the
    OAM loopback is in a transition state but should not persist. 

    The values of this attribute correspond to the following
    values of the local and remote parser and multiplexer states.

        by a period of time (for example, 10 frames in 1 second 
        had errors).
      - Errored Frame Seconds Summary Event.  Generated when the 
        number of errored frame seconds exceeds a threshold within
        a given time period (for example, 10 errored frame seconds
        within the last 100 seconds).  An errored frame second is 
        defined as a 1 second interval which had >0 frame errors.  
    There are other events (dying gasp, critical events) that are
    not threshold crossing events but which can be
    enabled/disabled via this table.
