    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module for management of network clock        distribution
        and the Network Clock Distribution Protocol (NCDP) in Cisco 
        devices.

        In the context of this MIB 'network clock' refers to the
        clock signal that is used to time the physical interfaces.
        Network clock distribution refers to the distribution of a
        clock signal through a device and between devices for use
        by the physical interfaces.  (See Bell Communications 
        Research, GR-1244-CORE, 'Clocks for the Synchronized
        Network: Common  Generic Criteria' and Bell Communications
        Research, GR-436-CORE, 'Digital Network Synchronization 
        Plan').

        NCDP is used to configure the network clocking hardware of 
        the platform on which an NCDP entity exists.  The underlying
        network clocking hardware in turn distributes a clock signal
        through the device for use by the physical interfaces.  When
        all of the interfaces that support synchronous clock 
        recovery in a network are timed to one master clock signal,
        the network is said to be synchronized.

         NCDP protocol entities residing on adjacent devices 
        cooperate through the exchange of protocol messages to
         construct a spanning network clock distribution tree.
        The tree preserves the synchronous digital hierarchy.

        After NCDP has determined that its algorithm has converged
        it superimposes the clock distribution tree on the
        underlying network and the result is a synchronized
        network."

    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The maximum possible height of a network clock distribution
        tree in the network.  (Alternatively this is known as the 
        maximum diameter of the network of devices that are 
        participating in NCDP.)  If all of the nodes in the network 
        are participating in the protocol then the maximum height of
        the network clock distribution tree is exactly the maximum
        diameter of the network.  If a proper subset of the nodes
        are participating in the NCDP then the maximum height of a
        network clock distribution tree is the maximum diameter of 
        the subnetwork induced by the removal of the 
        non-participating nodes and their associated links.

        The NCDP protocol entity uses the value of this object to
        determine when the NCDP algorithm has converged.  All 
        devices participating in NCDP within the bounds of the
        network must use the same value for maximum network diameter
        for the NCDP algorithm to operate properly. If the value of
        this object is set too small the resultant network may 
        exhibit unstable clocking characteristics and may constantly
        switch clock sources.  If the value is much larger than the
        network diameter, the algorithm will take longer to declare
        convergence than if the diameter were set closer to the 
        actual maximum network diameter, the result being that it 
        will take longer for the network to resynchronize after a 
        switchover to a secondary clock source located on a
        secondary device.

        This object is only used by the NCDP protocol entity."

        The message interval directly affects the convergence time 
        of the NCDP algorithm.  Convergence time is equal to the max 
        network diameter * message interval + transmission delays + 
        the time a configuration PDU is spent being processed in  
        each device.  Thus if transmission delays and processing 
        delays are  both close to 0, the convergence time is
        approximately ( max network diameter * message interval )
        milliseconds.

        The value of cncNcdpHoldTime should normally match the value

        configuration PDUs out of an interface to a maximum of one
        configuration PDU per hold time interval per interface.

        The value of this object should normally be set        to match the

        'lossOfLock' indicates that the clock source was

        because the network clocking hardware detected a loss of

        "Network clock status and statistics for sources of network

        the managed system uses this table to select a source of 
        network clock for the managed system.  Within this table a
        physical entity that is a source of network clock is 
        identified by cncManualSourceId.  Table entries are indexed 
        by priority (cncManualSourcePriority).

        A source of network clock for the device may be an

        When the managed system initializes it creates a row for

        Other rows are created or destroyed by a management station
        or through the device's local management interface when a 
        source of network clock is configured or removed.  When a
        management station creates a row it creates it explicitly

        A row is not made active until a valid value for
        cncManualSourceId is supplied.  A management station may
        perform a write operation on any columnar object while the
        row is active or not in service.

        The value of any instance of cncManualSourceId located in
        the table is unique except when the value refers to the

        "Network clock status and statistics for sources of network
        clock identified by entPhysicalIndex and used by the managed
        system when the value of cncDistributionMethod is 'ncdp'.

        A source of network clock for the device may be an
        oscillator local to the device, a Building Integrated Timing
        Supply (BITS) port or an interface that supports synchronous
        clock recovery.
        (BITS is explained in more detail in Bell Communications
        Research, GR-436-CORE, 'Digital Network Synchronization 
        Plan'.)

        The NCDP protocol entity selects one entry in this table to
        advertise as the best available clock source for the device.
        Cooperating NCDP protocol entities select the best available
        clock source among those advertised within the cooperating
        group and build a clock        distribution tree rooted at that 
        clock source.  When the value of cncRootClockSource is used
        as an index into this table and the indicated clock source
        has cncNcdpBestClockSource with value 'true' then the
        indicated clock source is the root of some clock
        distribution tree.  If only one such root exists on all 
        participating devices in the network, then it is the root of
        a network wide clock distribution tree.

        When the managed system initializes it creates a row for the
        device's default source of network clock.  This row cannot be
        destroyed by a management station.  Within this row a write
        operation is only allowed on the cncNcdpPriority object; only
        read operations are allowed on all other columnar objects
        within this specific row.  The status of this row is always
        active.  The default source can always be found by issuing a
        read operation on the row within cncManualSourceTable indexed
        by 'default' (as the value of cncManualSourcePriority).  The
        cncManualSourceId object contains the entPhysicalIndex of the
        default source of network clock and identifies it within this
        table.

        Other rows are created or destroyed by a management station
        or through the device's local management interface when a 
        source of network clock is configured or removed.  When a
        management station creates a row it creates it explicitly  
        using RowStatus with either createAndGo or createAndWait. 
        A row is not made active until all read-create objects not 
        having default values are properly initialized.

        The values of cncNcdpPriority, cncNcdpStratum and
        cncNcdpPRSReference collectively describe a source of network
        clock, that is they are three components of a vector used as 
        an input to the NCDP algorithm to make clock source selection
        decisions.  The management station must make the row
