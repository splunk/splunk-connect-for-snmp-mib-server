   DESCRIPTION
      "This object indicates the power measured for the Energy

      is specified in SI units of watts with the magnitude of
      watts (milliwatts, kilowatts, etc.) indicated separately
      in eoPowerUnitMultiplier.  The accuracy of the measurement
      is specified in eoPowerAccuracy.  The direction of power
      flow is indicated by the sign on eoPower.  If the Energy
      Object is consuming power, the eoPower value will be
      positive.  If the Energy Object is producing power, the
      eoPower value will be negative.

      The eoPower MUST be less than or equal to the maximum
      power that can be consumed at the Power State specified
      by eoPowerState.

      The eoPowerMeasurementCaliber object specifies how the

      aggregate power on behalf of another device.  In such
      cases it is not known whether the usage reported is
      actual, estimated, or static.

      - actual(3):  Indicates that the reported usage was
      measured by the entity through some hardware or direct
      physical means.  The usage data reported is not estimated
      or static but is the measured consumption rate.

      - estimated(4): Indicates that the usage was not
      determined by physical measurement.  The value is a
      derivation based upon the device type, state, and/or
      current utilization using some algorithm or heuristic.  It
      is presumed that the entity's state and current
      configuration were used to compute the value.

      - static(5): Indicates that the usage was not determined
      by physical measurement, algorithm, or derivation.  The
      usage was reported based upon external tables,
