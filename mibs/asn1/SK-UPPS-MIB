-- Topology statistics
-- Instances of these object types represent attributes of an
-- interface to an Ethernet Token Ring or FDDI communications
-- medium.  Only one object group has to be implemented at the
-- same time depending on the hardware of the communication
-- adapter.

-- The ethernet object group is a part of the internet draft
-- 'ETHERNET LIKE OBJECTS'.

-- The FDDI object group is partially from the RFC1285
-- 'FDDI Management Information Base'.
-- textual conventions
-- FddiMACLongAddressType ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (6))
-- The representation of long MAC addresses as management
-- values is in the IEEE (ANSI/IEEE P802.1A) canonical
-- notation for 48 bit addresses.  The canonical form is a
-- 6-octet string where the first octet contains the first 8
-- bits of the address, with the I/G (Individual/Group)
-- address bit as the least significant bit and the  U/L
-- (Universal/Local) bit as the next more significant bit,
-- and so on.  Note that the addresses in the SMT frames are
-- represented in FDDI MAC order.
