--  This is a SNMPv1 translation of Digital Equipment Corporation's LAN
--  Emulation Server MIB.
--
--  Initial translation was done by the tool
--          SMIC (the next generation) version 1.6.31
--
--  The machine-generated MIB was then modified to remove all remaining
--  SNMP version 2 constructs.

-- AtmLaneAddress ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(0..20))
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    A twenty-octet binary string, containing a standard
--     ATM Forum address == or the zero-length string,
--     indicating the absence of an address.
--    
--     For LAN Emulation purposes, the eight-octet address
--     format is not used.

-- VpiInteger ::= INTEGER(0..255)
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    An integer large enough to hold a VPI.

-- VciInteger ::= INTEGER(0..65535)
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    An integer large enough to hold a VCI.

-- LesConnectionInterface ::= INTEGER(0..2147483647)
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    A combination flag and ifTable index, indicating
--     whether a LAN Emulation circuit exists - and, if
--     so, which interface is associated with it at the
--     point where it connects to a server.
--    
--     Objects of this type are always defined as part of
--     a set that includes
--    
--             fooInterface   LesConnectionInterface
--             fooVpi         VpiInteger
--             fooVci         VciInteger
--    
--     The interpretation of these objects is as follows.
--    
--     1.  If no connection exists, 'fooInterface' has a
--         value of 0.  Because Interfaces table entries
--         always have 'ifIndex' values larger than 0,
--         'fooInterface' reliably serves as a 'connection
--         exists' flag.
--    
--         In this case, 'fooVpi' and 'fooVci' are
--         meaningless, and have the value 0.
--    
--     2.  If a PVC or SVC exists, 'fooInterface' is defined
--         to have the value of the MIB-II/RFC 1573 'ifIndex'
--         of the 'atm' interface associated with the VCC.
--         'fooVpi' and 'fooVci' will contain its VPI/VCI.
--         Therefore, ('fooInterface', 'fooVpi', 'fooVci')
--         give you an index into the AToM MIB which allows
--         you to examine and play with the circuit further.
