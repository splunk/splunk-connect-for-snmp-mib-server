  DESCRIPTION 
      "Based on the PWE3 Requirements/Framework, the original 
       CEM MIB (draft-danenberg-sonet-ces-mpls-mib-00.txt) has 
       Been split into 3 drafts: 

         - PW-STD-MIB     (Zelig, et al).  Service-independent MIB. 
         - PW-TC-STD-MIB  (Nadeau, et al). Textual Conventions. 
         - PW-CEP-STD-MIB (Danenberg, et al). Service-specific MIB. 

       Aside from the split, then PW-CEM-MIB has undergone 
       other changes: 

         - Ability to define LOPS (loss of packet sync), SES 
           and UAS. 
         - Support for 'unstructured' operation. 
         - Support for CEM-RDI. 
         - Many more minor changes and clarifications."

       The value will be <n> unless the measurement was (re-)

       value will be the number of complete 15 minute intervals for  
       which the agent has at least some data. In certain cases  
       (e.g., in the case where the agent is a proxy) it is

       missingPkt - While playing out a sequence of packets, a  
       packet(s) was determined to be missing based on a gap in the  
       CEP sequence number. Note: If the implementation supports  
       packet re-ordering, detecting gaps should not take place as  
       packets arrive, only as they are played out - this gives  
       time for mis-ordered packets to arrive late. 
        
       ooRngDropped - Packet(s) arrives that is outside the 
       range of the jitter buffer. This may be because the 
       jitter buffer is full, or the sequence number addresses 
       a buffer outside the current jitter buffer range, or 
       addresses an already occupied buffer within range. 
       Whether or not packet re-ordering is supported by the 
       implementation, this indication MUST be supported.

       played out.  
        
       pktBadLength - Non-bandwidth-saving packet arrives 
       larger or smaller than pwVcCepCfgSonetPayloadLength, or when 
       a fractional SPE packet length does not match the extension 
       header or manual configuration indicating the number of

       lops - Loss Of Packet Sync. See draft-ietf-pwe3-sonet. 
        
       cepRdi - Circuit Emulation over Packet Remote Defect  
       Indication. Generated by the remote CEP de-packetizer when  
       detecting LOPS. Note: not generated by the remote SONET  
       function. See draft-ietf-pwe3-sonet. 
        
       cepAis - Remote CEP packetizer has detected AIS 
       on its incoming SONET stream. See draft-ietf-pwe3- 
       sonet. Note: cepAis MUST NOT (in itself) cause a CEP 
       down notification. This would be a layer violation.

       CEP header extensions detected in incoming packets does 
       not match the expected number.
