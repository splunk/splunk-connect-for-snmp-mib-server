    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB provides information and statistics on the traffic
        processor(s) of a service control entity, which is a network
        element that monitors network traffic between network
        subscribers based on user configured policies.

        A service control entity uses traffic processor(s) for packet
        processing and flow handling in the host network.

        The traffic processor(s) data obtained from this MIB may also
        reflect the general load in the system."
