         length field in order to convey/determine how many octets
         are being used.   Each bit corresponds to a port, as
         represented by its ifIndex value . When a bit has the value
         one(1), the corresponding port is a member of the set. When
         a bit has the value zero(0), the corresponding port is not a
         member of the set. The encoding is such that the most
         significant bit of octet #1 corresponds to ifIndex 0, while
         the least significant bit of the last octet corresponds to
         ifIndex ((octet_string_length * 8) - 1).  For example, the
         least significant bit of octet #64 corresponds to ifIndex 511."
