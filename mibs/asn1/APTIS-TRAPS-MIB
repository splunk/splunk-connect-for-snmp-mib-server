--  Guidelines for modifying this file:
--  1) Do not use tabs, only spaces.
--  2) For trap pairs (e.g., down/up), use an odd number for the 1st
--     trap and an even number for the 2nd trap.  Generally, the 1st
--     trap would be the alarm causing trap and the 2nd one would be
--     the alarm clearing trap.
--  3) Alarm creating traps and alarm clearing traps should have the
--     same severity.  The most important reason for this is that if
--     a trap severity filter is on, if the user sees an alarm creating
--     trap, he/she should also be able to see the corresponding alarm
--     clearing trap.

--    The following has been taken from the V2 version of this MIB, for
--    the most part, and commented out for this V1 version.
