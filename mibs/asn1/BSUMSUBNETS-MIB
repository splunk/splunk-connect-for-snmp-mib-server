	DESCRIPTION
	   "This group gives the BSU Multiple Subnets information. 
	    
	    The aniBsuSubnetConfTable is used to view and configure
	    subnets per wireless port.

	    There can be upto 1024 <Ip Address/Subnet Mask> pairs.
	    For a given WSS port, there can be multiple and different 
	    subnets. This means that each subnet specified by an
	    <Ip Address masked by the Subnet Mask> has to be distinct.
	    Atleast one Ip Address and Subnet Mask has to be specified.
	    In addition to the subnet being distinct, each IP Address 
	    must be unique too.

	    If clustering is disabled, then Multiple Subnets on one
	    WSS port should not clash with Multiple Subnets on any
	    other WSS port.
	     
	    Clustering and multiple subnets can exists simultaneously 
	    as long as they are not on the same WSS. If clustering is 
	    enabled but not all WSS are clustered, then those that are 
	    not part of the cluster can have multiple subnets. 
	    Eg. If WSS1 and WSS2 are clustered, but WSS3 and WSS4 are 
	    not, then WSS3 and WSS4 can have multiple subnets.

	    To add a new subnet to the table, first set the 
	    aniBsuSubnetConfAddr. Next send an SNMP set request
	    on aniBsuSubnetConfMask.

	    Currently, deletion and modification of entries is not supported.

	    When the BSU is in Bridge mode, this multiple subnets table is 
	    not valid and will not be displayed.
