       DESCRIPTION
         "The objects in this MIB module are used to manage the
         multi-pair bonded xDSL Interfaces using time-division inverse
         multiplexing (TDIM), defined in ITU-T recommendation G.998.3
         (G.Bond/TDIM).

         This MIB module MUST be used in conjunction with GBOND-MIB
         module, common to all G.Bond technologies.

         The following references are used throughout this MIB module:

           ITU-T Recommendation G.998.1: 'Multi-pair bonding using
           time-division inverse multiplexing', January 2005.

         [WT-159] refers to:
           DSL Forum Technical Report: 'Management Framework for xDSL
           Bonding', January 2007.
