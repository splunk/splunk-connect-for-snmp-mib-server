		"The x21IfTable contains information relating to the 
                interfaces found on the system. Each entry corresponds to
                a connected X21 interface. Entries can only be added or 
		deleted by the system. 

                Creating entries: Entries are created by the system
                only when a new X21 module is installed.

                Deleting entries: Entries are removed by the system
                after the appropriate X21 module is removed."
