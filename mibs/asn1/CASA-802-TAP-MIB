        DESCRIPTION
                "This module manages Casa's intercept feature for 
                802 (layer 2) streams.

                This MIB is used along with CASA-TAP2-MIB to
                intercept 802 traffic. CASA-TAP2-MIB along with
                specific filter MIBs like this MIB replace
                CASA-TAP-MIB.

                To create an 802 intercept, an entry Casa802tapStreamEntry 
                is created which contains the filter details. An entry
                casaTap2StreamEntry of CASA-TAP2-MIB is created which 
                is the common stream information for all kinds of 
                intercepts and type of the specific stream is set to
                mac in this entry."

     DESCRIPTION
        "The Intercept Stream 802 Table lists the IEEE 802 data streams
        to be intercepted.  The same data stream may be required by
        multiple taps, and one might assume that often the intercepted
        stream is a small subset of the traffic that could be
        intercepted.

        This essentially provides options for packet selection, only
        some of which might be used. For example, if all traffic to or
        from a given interface is to be intercepted, one would
        configure an entry which lists the interface, and wild-card
        everything else.  If all traffic to or from a given MAC Address
        is to be intercepted, one would configure two such entries
        listing the MAC Address as source and destination respectively,
        and wild-card everything else.

        The first index indicates which Mediation Device the
        intercepted traffic will be diverted to. The second index
        permits multiple classifiers to be used together, such as
        having a MAC address as source or destination.

        Entries are added to this table via c802tapStreamStatus in 
        accordance with the RowStatus convention."

     STATUS     current
     DESCRIPTION
        "The ifIndex value of the interface over which traffic to be
        intercepted is received or transmitted. The interface may be
        physical or virtual. If this is the only parameter specified,
        and it is other than -1 or 0, all traffic on the selected
        interface will be chosen.

        If the value is zero, matching traffic may be received or
        transmitted on any interface.  Additional selection parameters
        must be selected to limit the scope of traffic intercepted.
        This is most useful on non-routing platforms or on intercepts
        placed elsewhere than a subscriber interface.

        If the value is -1, one or both of
        casa802tapStreamDestinationAddress and casa802tapStreamSourceAddress
        must be specified.  Matching traffic on the interface pointed
        to by the dot1dTpFdbPort values associated with those values is
        intercepted, whichever is specified.  If dot1dTpFdbPort
        changes, either by operator action or by protocol events, the
        interface will change with it. This is primarily intended for
        use on subscriber interfaces and other places where routing is
        guaranteed to be symmetrical.

        In both of these cases, it is possible to have the same packet
        selected for intersection on both its ingress and egress
        interface.  Nonetheless, only one instance of the packet is
        sent to the Mediation Device.

        This value must be set when creating a stream entry, either to
        select an interface, to select all interfaces, or to select the
        interface that bridging learns. Some platforms may not
        implement the entire range of options."
