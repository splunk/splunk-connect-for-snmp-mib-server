    DESCRIPTION
       "A list of alarm table entries.  The table contains
        zero, one, or many rows at any moment, depending upon
        the number of alarm conditions in effect.  The table
        is initially empty at agent startup.  The agent
        creates a row in the table each time a condition is
        detected and deletes that row when that condition no
        longer pertains.  The agent creates the first row with
        falconAlarmId equal to 1, and increments the value of
        falconAlarmId each time a new row is created, wrapping to
        the first free value greater than or equal to 1 when
        the maximum value of falconAlarmId would otherwise be
        exceeded.  Consequently, after multiple operations,
        the table may become sparse, e.g., containing entries
        for rows 95, 100, 101, and 203 and the entries should
        not be assumed to be in chronological order because
        falconAlarmId might have wrapped.

        Alarms are named by an AutonomousType (OBJECT
        IDENTIFIER), falconAlarmDescr, to allow a single table to
        reflect well known alarms plus alarms defined by a
        particular implementation, i.e., as documented in the
        private enterprise MIB definition for the device.  No
        two rows will have the same value of falconAlarmDescr,
        since alarms define conditions.  In order to meet this
        requirement, care should be taken in the definition of
        alarm conditions to insure that a system cannot enter
        the same condition multiple times simultaneously.

        The number of rows in the table at any given time is
        reflected by the value of falconAlarmsPresent."
