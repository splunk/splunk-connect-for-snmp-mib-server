		startLog(3). Log event pausing is independent of any other
		log filtering mechanisms, e.g., levels. Setting it to

 		 all(1) The all level has the lowest possible rank and is intended
 		 to turn on all logging.
 		   
 		 trace(2) The trace level designates finer-grained informational 
 		 events than the DEBUG (see log4j class for further definition).
 
 		 debug(3) The debug level designates fine-grained informational 
 		 events that are most useful to debug an application.
 
 		 info(4) The info level designates informational messages that 
 		 highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained level.
 
 		 warn(5) The warn level designates potentially harmful situations.
 
 		 error(6) The error level designates error events that might still 
 		 allow the application to continue running.
 
 		 fatal(7) The fatal level designates very severe error events 
 		 that will presumably lead the application to abort.

 -- The ANI Device System Logging table.

-- and applications. Note that network-related events are still
-- recorded in the aniDevSysLoggingEventTable. The ANI device adds an
-- event by adding a conceptual row to the end of the table.
-- Once the table 'fills' by reaching aniDevSysLoggingSize, adding a 
-- new event causes the oldest conceptual row to be removed.
