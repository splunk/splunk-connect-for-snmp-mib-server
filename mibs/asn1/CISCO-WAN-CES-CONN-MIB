    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module to configure the Circuit Emulation
        connections in MGX82xx series products.

        Terminology:
        CES                : Circuit Emulation Service.
                             The CES defines a method of
                             carrying a traffic from non-ATM telephony
                             devices over an ATM cloud. The CES provides
                             an interworking function(IWF) that allows
                             the two protocols to communicate.
        channel , endpoint : channel and connection endpoint 
                             have same meaning and are used 
                             interchangebly.
        DAX Connection     : Digital Access and Cross-connect connection
                             is a connection where master and slave
                             endpoints are with in the same MGX shelf.
        CAS                : Channel Associated Signaling. This
                             is in-band signaling.
        CCS                : Common Channel Signaling. This is
                             is out-of-band signaling."

                           This service utilizes the entire T1

                          The SRTS measures the difference between

                          the circuit in the AAL1 header.
                          The receiving end reconstructs the clock by

                          The local (interface) service clock is
