-- All representations of MAC addresses in this MIB Module use,
-- as a textual convention (i.e. this convention does not affect
-- their encoding), the data type:

MacAddress ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (6))    -- a 6 octet address in
                                          -- the "canonical" order
-- defined by IEEE 802.1a, i.e., as if it were transmitted least
-- significant bit first, even though 802.5 (in contrast to other
-- 802.x protocols) requires MAC addresses to be transmitted most
-- significant bit first.
--
-- 16-bit addresses, if needed, are represented by setting their
-- upper 4 octets to all 0's, i.e., AAFF would be represented
-- as 00000000AAFF.

-- Experimental Branches
--
-- When RFCs are still in the experimental stage, the MIB
-- is incorporated under the enterprise experimental branch
-- so that changes in the experimental MIB do not affect
-- the released product.  
--
-- As the RFC becomes standard and support is provided by the agents,
-- the support under this branch will be moved to the appropriate
-- standard branch.  That is, the support under this branch
-- for the MIB in question will be removed.

-- Station and Port Traffic


-- The OlTRTrafControl, OlTRTrafStation, OlTRTrafPort, OlTRTrafTopN, and
-- OlTRTrafTopNSummary Groups

--
-- New stations on the token ring network are discovered by
-- keeping a list of source and destination MAC Addresses seen
-- in good frames.  For each of these addresses, a set of statistics
-- is maintained.  The OlTRTrafStation, OlTRTrafPort, OlTRTrafTopN,
-- and OlTRTrafTopNSummary Groups provide four different ways
-- to retrieve this information.
--
-- Note that the list of stations will include
--	- stations internal to the concentrator on the local ring
--	- stations external to the concentrator on the local ring
-- 	- stations on remote rings
--
-- If the list is full, the least recently used entries not on the local ring
-- will be deleted first, as needed.

-- The olTRTrafStationTable contains entries for each address
-- discovered on a particular interface.  Each entry
-- contains statistical data about that station.  This table
-- is indexed by Network ID and the MAC address of the station.

-- The olTRTrafPortTable contains data in the same format as the
-- olTRTrafStationTable, and contains the same set of stations
-- except that stations external to the concentrator or not on the local ring
-- are omitted.  The olTRTrafPortTable is
-- indexed by Network ID, SlotIndex and PortIndex.

-- The olTRTrafTopNTable is composed of 7 sublists, one for each statistic.
-- Each sublist contains the same set of stations as
-- olTRTrafStationTable.  The stations in each sublist are sorted by
-- the statistic specified in olTRTrafTopNStatistic.
-- The olTRTrafTopNTable is indexed by olTRTrafTopNNetID,
-- by olTRTrafTopNStatistic to identify the sublist,
-- and by olTRTrafTopNIndex (1..N) with index 1 referring to
-- the entry with the highest value of the specifed counter.
-- (See description of olTRTrafTopNTable)

-- The olTRTrafTopNSummaryTable contains the same information as
-- olTRTrafTopNTable, but in a condensed format.

-- Note that table entries may be added, deleted, or resorted at any time.
-- There are three methods available for a management station to address this.

-- METHOD 1
-- Each of the 4 tables has an associated "-LastChangeTime" entry in
-- olTRTrafControlTable.  A management station should read the
-- associated "-LastChangeTime" entry before and after reading a group of
-- table entries.  If the before and after "-LastChangeTimes differ then the
-- management station should repeat the reading of table entries.

-- METHOD 2
-- Use olTRTrafControlLogicalLock and olTRTrafControlLogicalState to ensure
-- that changes don't occur while retrieving table entries.
-- (see description below)

-- METHOD 3
-- Don't worry about table entry changes.  Probably they won't happen while
-- you are reading the table.  The worst that would happen is you might miss
-- a few stations or see the same station twice in the list.
