         The value is an ASCII string similar to a URL, and must be in one
         of the following formats:
           - 'usb://<filename>' - the help file is located on the usb port
                          of the switch, if not in stack, or on the usb 
                          port of the base unit, if in stack.
           - 'usb://<unit-number>/<filename>' - the help file is located
                          on the usb port of the switch, if not in stack,
                          or on the usb port of the specified unit,
