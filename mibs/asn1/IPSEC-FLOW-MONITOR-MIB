    DESCRIPTION
         "This is a MIB Module for monitoring the structure
      and status of IPSec-based networks. The MIB has bee
      designed to be adopted as an IETF standard. Henc
      vendor-specific features of IPSec protocol are exclude
      from this MIB.

      Acronyms
      The following acronyms are used in this document:

       IPSec:      Secure IP Protocol

       VPN:        Virtual Private Network

       ISAKMP:     Internet Security Association and Key Exchange
                   Protocol

       IKE:        Internet Key Exchange Protocol

       SA:         Security Association

       MM:         Main Mode - the process of setting up
                   a Phase 1 SA to secure the exchanges
                   required to setup Phase 2 SAs

       QM:         Quick Mode - the process of setting up
                   Phase 2 Security Associations using
                   a Phase 1 SA.

       Phase 1 Tunnel:
                   An ISAKMP SA can be regarded as representing
                   a flow of ISAKMP/IKE traffic. Hence an ISAKMP
                   is referred to as a 'Phase 1 Tunnel' in this
                   document

       Control Tunnel:
                   Another term for a Phase 1 Tunnel.

       Phase 2 Tunnel:
                   AN instance of a non-ISAKMP SA  bundle in which all
                   the SA share the same proxy identifiers (IDii,IDir)
                   protect the same stream of application traffic.
                   Such an SA bundle is termed a 'Phase 2 Tunnel'.
                   Note that a Phase 2 tunnel may comprise different
                   SA bundles and different number of SA bundles at
                   different times (due to key refresh).


       Overview of IPsec MIB

    The MIB contains six major groups of objects which are
    used to manage the IPSec Protocol. These groups include
    a Levels Group, a Phase-1 Group, a Phase-2 Group,
    a History Group, a Failure Group and a TRAP Control Group.
    The following table illustrates the structure of the
    IPSec MIB.

    The Phase 1 group models objects pertaining to
    IKE negotiations and Phase 1 tunnels.

    The Phase 2 group models objects pertaining to
    IPSec data tunnels.

    The History group is to aid applications that do
    trending analysis.

    The Failure group is to enable an operator to
    do troubleshooting and debugging of the VPN Router.
    Further, counters are supported to aid detection
    of potential security violations.

    In addition to the five major MIB Groups, there are
    a number of Notifications. The following table
    illustrates the name and description of the
    IPSec TRAPs.

    draft draft-ietf-ipsec-flow-monitoring-mib-01.txt.

    REVISION "9911041800Z"
    DESCRIPTION
      "Initial version of this MIB module proposed to IETF."

    REVISION    "2001031200Z"
    DESCRIPTION
      "Phase-1 group updated with mode config metrics in globals
      as well as IKE peer table.
      Phase-2 group updated with new group metrics. New grou
      failures added to Failure group.
      Notifications pertaining to new group added.
      SPI table deprecated and an updated IPsec SA table added.
      Compliance clauses updated."

    REVISION    "200303021158Z"
    DESCRIPTION
      "Third submission of the draft to IETF. Changes incorporated
      based on comments received on the second draft. Highlights:
        1) IKE Group made optional
        2) Provision to accomodate other Phase 1 protocols.
        3) Phase 1 Peer Association table decoupled from
           IKE group.
        4) Local and Remote value indices to Phase 1 Pee
           Association table constrained to 128-bit length by MD5
	   hashing.
        5) Mapping of Phase 2 tunnels to Phase 1 tunnels
           made generic (non-IKE).
        6) Phase 1 traps redefined as `Control Channel' traps.
        7) High capacity counters defined for Phase-1 and Phase-2
           expired counters."
