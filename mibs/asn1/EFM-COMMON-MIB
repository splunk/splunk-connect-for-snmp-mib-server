       DESCRIPTION
         "The MIB module for managing the new Ethernet OAM features
         introduced by the Ethernet in the First Mile task force (IEEE
         802.3ah).  The functionality presented here is based on IEEE
         802.3ah [802.3ah], released in October, 2004.  
  
         In particular, this MIB focused on the changes to Clause 30 of
         the draft that are not specific to any physical layer.  These
         changes are primarily reflected in the new OAM features
         developed under this project, that can be applied to any
         Ethernet like interface. The OAM features are described in
         Clause 57 of [802.3ah].
  
         The following reference is used throughout this MIB module:  
  
           [802.3ah] refers to:

             metropolitan are networks - Specific requirements - Part

       DESCRIPTION 
         "At initialization and failure conditions, two OAM entities on
         the same full-duplex Ethernet link begin a discovery phase to
         determine what OAM capabilities may be used on that link.  The
         progress of this initialization is controlled by the OAM
         sublayer.  
                    
         This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on this
         interface via the dot3OamAdminState.  
  
         If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAMPDUs
         with a link fault indication, the value is linkFault(2). 
                          
         The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in
         passive mode (dot3OamMode) and reflects the state in which the
         OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer device is OAM
         capable.  The activeSendLocal(4) is used by active mode
         devices (dot3OamMode) and reflects the OAM entity actively
         trying to discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has
         not yet made that determination.  
                          
         The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OAM
         entity has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or
         rejected the configuration of the peer.  The local device can,
         for whatever reason, decide that the peer device is
         unacceptable and decline OAM peering.  If the local OAM entity
         rejects the peer OAM entity, the state becomes
         oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7).  If the OAM peering is allowed
         by the local device, the state moves to
         sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6).  Note that both the
         sendLocalAndRemote(5) and oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7) states
         fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE of the Discovery state
         diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being
         whether the local OAM client has actively rejected the peering
         or has just not indicated any decision yet.  Whether a peering
         decision has been made is indicated via the local flags field
         in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of
         30.3.6.1.10).  
  
         If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state
         becomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8).  Note that both the
         sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6) and oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8)
         states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE_OK of the
                         EFM OAM MIB                March 2005


         Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the
         difference being whether the remote OAM client has rejected
         the peering or has just not yet decided.  This is indicated
         via the remote flags field in the OAM PDU (reflected in the
         aOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11).  
                          
         When the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote
         OAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to
         operational(9) corresponding to the SEND_ANY state of the
         Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5].  "

         Ethernet like interface.  OAM on Ethernet interfaces may be in
         'active' mode or 'passive' mode.  These two modes differ in
         that active mode provides additional capabilities to initiate
         monitoring activities with the remote OAM peer entity, while
         passive mode generally waits for the peer to initiate OAM
         actions with it.  As an example, an active OAM entity can put
         the remote OAM entity in a loopback state, where a passive OAM
         entity cannot.  
  
         The default value of dot3OamMode is dependent on the type of
         system on which this Ethernet like interface resides.  The
         default value should be 'active(1)' unless it is known that
         this system should take on a subservient role to the other
         device connected over this interface.  
  
         Changing this value results in incrementing the configuration
         revision field of locally generated OAMPDUs (30.3.6.1.12) and
         potentially re-doing the OAM discovery process if the
         dot3OamOperStatus was already operational(9).  "
