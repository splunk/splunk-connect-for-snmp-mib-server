-- The Statistics Group

-- The statistics group in token ring remote network monitoring MIB contains
-- counters for MAC layer frame and byte throughput in terms of promiscuous,
-- multicast and broadcast address.  Also, it contains counters for MAC layer
-- state transitions, MAC and physical layer errors and the size distribution
-- of data frames.  The data frame size distribution is subjected to the view
-- with which the tokenRingStatsDataSource object is associated.

-- The History Group

-- The history group periodically takes statistical samples from a network
-- and stores them for later retrieval.  The counters in the history group
-- is a subset in the statistics group.  In the history group, the counters
-- contain the statistics accumulated during the last sample.

-- The objects and structure in the history group are the same between Ethernet
-- and token ring remote network monitoring MIBs, except that the prefix of
-- the objects' names are changed from "ether" to "tokenRing" and the counters
-- in EtherHistoryEntry are replaced by the counters in TokenRingHistoryEntry.
-- The token ring history shares the control table with the ethernet version;
-- it is in the rmon mib.

-- The MIB address of the objects are enumerated from 1 to infinity.  The
-- address of the first object, which is tokenRingHistoryIndex , is
-- { tokenRingHistoryEntry 1 }, and so on.
