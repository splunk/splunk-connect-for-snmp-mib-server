    DESCRIPTION
            "This object is used to configure the level of SNMP
	     access that the agent supports. That is, which
	     combinations of Model Processing can be dispatched
	     and what security levels are supported for those models.

	     An agent can choose to support more than a single 
	     combination of modes, (e.g., SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 with
	     noAuthNoPriv) or choose to support a single option
	     (e.g., a very secured agent with only SNMPv3 with
             authentication and privacy enabled.). Even some of
	     these combinations may not be supported at all.

	     Setting this object to a valid value will cause 
	     the entries associated with those Models and
	     SecurityLevels being changed to become active/inactive
	     in tables processed by the SNMPv3 Framework.
