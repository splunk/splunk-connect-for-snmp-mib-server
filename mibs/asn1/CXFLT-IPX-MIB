whether data is filtered or forwarded from the source address to the 
destination address.

This number must be entered as 8 hexadecimal characters (four octets), for 
example 0xAB12CD34. The 0x must be present in every number; it indicates 
that the number is a hex number and is not counted as one of the octets. 
The x must be lowercase; the other characters are not case sensitive.
