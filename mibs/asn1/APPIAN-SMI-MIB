--
--      Date:   11/1/99
--
--      Description:
--
--      This file contains the top level SMI definitions for the Appian 
--      Communications Inc. Enterprise MIB.  The MIB is designed to support a 
--      variety of Appian specific hardware platforms.
--
--      The purpose of this MIB definition file is two fold, a) to provide a
--      start for the Appian MIB hierarchy  and b) to provide a place to record
--      any Appian specific Macros.
--
--      Please follow the rules of MIB obsolescence and deprecation  when adding
--      or deleting MIB attributes, leafs or nodes.  AppianVista relies on the
--      structure not changing.
--
--      When considering adding a new node to the tree, please make sure to
--      to add it under the appropriate node categories below.  When there is
--      confusions, check with the author of this document.
--
--      If you have a well known type you wish to publish in our enterpris
--      tree, this is the place to define it.  These are well known types that
--      currently are not defined in a standard, but are common in Appian 
--      specific MIBs.  Enums are a great place to be defined here.  Please
--      only define common types which would be reused in sub-modules.  If its
--      common, but only to your portion of the tree, define in your root
--      level module.
--
--      Note: Each node in the tree below represents a unique ASN.1 source
--      file in our system.  Please preserve the number space and when adding
--      new nodes, try and keep them in separate files, explicitly named.
