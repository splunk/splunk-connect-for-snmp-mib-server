	DESCRIPTION
		"This variable combines the enable ieee8023PromRx, disable
		ieee8023PromRx, and read ieee8023PromStatus MAC actions.
		Setting this variable to enabled causes the interface to
		accept frames regardless of their destination address.
		When enabled, all received frames increment all counters as

	STATUS	mandatory
	DESCRIPTION
		"This variable causes the MAC sublayer to enter the normal
		operational state at idle. The PLS is reset by this operation.
		It is accomplished by setting receiveEnabled and
		transmitEnabled to true. Setting this variable to enabled(1) 
		enables the MAC sublayer to both receive and transmit frames. 
		Setting this variable to enabled(1) will also set the 
		ieee8023TransmitStatus variable to enabled(1). Similarly, 
		setting this variable to disabled(2) will also set 
		ieee8023TransmitStatus to disabled(2). Modifying this variable 
		does not change the state of any other variables. If the 
		variable is set to disabled(2), then any current 
		transmission/reception is completed before the 
		transmission/reception process is disabled. The value 
		returned when this variable is read is the logical and of the 
		receiveEnabled and transmitEnabled MAC internal	state 
		variables. If both are in the enabled state, then enabled(1) 
		is returned; otherwise disabled(2) is returned."
