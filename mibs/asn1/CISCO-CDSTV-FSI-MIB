    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module defines FSI configurartion objects that
        faciliate the management of the Cisco Content Delivery System
        for TV (CDS-TV) product family.

        CDS-TV is a suite of products and software applications
        providing ingest, storage, caching, streaming, playout and
        on-demand delivery of video to television or set-top-box
        clients.

        Abbreviations:

        CDS     Content Delivery System
        ISA     Interactive Services Architecture
        ISV     Integrated Streamer-Vault
        FSI     File Service Interface
        FTP     File Transfer Protocol
        MPEG    Motion Picture Experts Group
        MSA     Managed Services Architecture
        RTSP    Real-Time Streaming Protocol
        STB     Set-Top Box

        Common terms:

        Catcher: Device responsible for receiving content (typically via
        satellite dishes and antennae) from content providers or from a
        Headend-In-The-Sky. 

        Content Ingest: Acquisition of content from a source such as a
        catcher or an FTP server for storing it locally and making it
        available to streamers as needed.

        Vault: Content delivery application responsible for ingesting
        and storing video content and making it available to streamers.

        Streamer: Content delivery application responsible for streaming
        video out to STB's."
