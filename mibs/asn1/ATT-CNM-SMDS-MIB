			that need to be indexed by a SMDS address.

			This object will contain the following information,
			describing how this agent expects OIDs to be formed:

				Country Code = 1
				Area Code = next 3 digits (eg. 908)
				Subscriber Number = remaining 7 digits

				Therefore, for example, an OID associated
				with a SMDS address 0xC19085804357FFFF is
				derived to be 1.908.5804537
			
			This information helps in specifying how this agent
