          "This MIB module contains managed object definitions for  
           Pseudo Wire operation as in: Bryant., et al, 'PWE3  
           architecture', Martini, L., et al, 'Pseudowire Setup and

   -- Editor note: will add RFC numbers when available. 
           This MIB module enables the use of any underlying packet  
           switched network (PSN). MIB nodules that will support 
           PW operations over specific PSN types are defined in

           The indexes for this MIB module are also used to index the 
           PSN-specific tables and the PW-specific tables. The PW Type 
           dictates which PW-specific MIB module to use.

          "This notification is generated when the 
           pwVcOperStatus object for one or more contiguous 
           entries in pwVcTable are about to enter the up(1) 
           state from some other state. The included values of 
           pwVcOperStatus MUST both be set equal to this 
           new state (i.e: up(1)).  The two instances of 
           pwVcOperStatus in this notification indicate the range 
           of indexes that are affected.  Note that all the indexes 
           of the two ends of the range can be derived from the 
           instance identifiers of these two objects.  For 
           cases where a contiguous range of cross-connects 
           have transitioned into the up(1) state at roughly 
           the same time, the device SHOULD issue a single 
           notification for each range of contiguous indexes in 
           an effort to minimize the emission of a large number 
           of notifications.  If a notification has to be 
           issued for just a single cross-connect entry, then 
           the instance identifier (and values) of the two 
           pwVcOperStatus objects MUST be the identical."
