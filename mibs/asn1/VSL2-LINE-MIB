      DESCRIPTION
           "
            This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB)
            module for use with network management protocols in the
            Internet community for the purpose of managing VDSL2, ADSL,
            ADSL2, and ADSL2+ lines.

            The MIB module described in RFC 2662 [RFC2662] defines
            objects used for managing Asymmetric Bit-Rate DSL (ADSL)
            interfaces per [T1E1.413], [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].
            These object descriptions are based upon the specifications
            for the ADSL Embedded Operations Channel (EOC) as defined
            in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) T1E1.413
            [T1E1.413] and International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T)
            G.992.1 [G.992.1] and G.992.2 [G.992.2].

            The MIB module described in RFC xxxx [RFCxxx] defines
            objects used for managing ADSL2 interfaces per [G.992.3]
            and [G.992.4], and ADSL2+ interfaces per [g.992.5]. That MIB
            is also capable of managing ADSL interfaces per [T1E1.413],
            [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].

            This document does not obsolete RFC 2662 [RFC2662] and
            RFCxxxx [RFCxxxx], but rather provides a more comprehensive
            management model that manages VDSL2 interfaces per G.993.2
            [G.993.2] as well as ADSL, ADSL2 and ADSL2+ technologies
            per T1E1.413, G.992.1, G.992.2, G.992.3, G.992.4, and
            G.992.5
            ([T1E1.413], [G.992.1], [G.992.2], [G.992.3], [G.992.4], and
            [G.992.5] respectively).

           Additionally, the management framework for VDSL2 lines
           specified by the Digital Subscriber Line Forum
           (DSLF) has been taken into consideration [TR-129].  That
           framework is based on ITU-T G.997.1 standard [G.997.1].

           The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2
           transmission, as discussed in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 2863
           [RFC2863]) section of this document.

           Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2006).  This version of
           this MIB module is part of RFC XXXX: see the RFC itself for
           full legal notices."
