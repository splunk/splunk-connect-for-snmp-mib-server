    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module manages the features and configuration
        for PDN Gateway(PGW) and Serving Gateway(SGW) in Evolved
        Packet Core(EPC) architecture.

        The PGW is the permanent IP point-of-attachment for 
        access via the E-UTRAN. The PGW performs IP policy and
        charging enforcement on packet flows to and from mobile 
        devices.

        The SGW is a local mobility anchor for E-UTRAN mobility,
        switching packets between the S5 interface and the GTP
        based S1-U interface for mobiles in connected mode.

        This architecture supports the non-roaming and roaming
        architectures using GTP based protocol on the PGW and SGW
        with a number of functions. It support high number of
        subscribers with their associated control messages and
        data traffic. Each of this association forms an entry in
        PGW and SGW and is commonly know as bearers.

        The various features used by this architecture and their
        attributes are captured in this MIB:

        1. Overload protection, handles congestion control, SGW and
        PGW represent congestion as a DFP metric considering the
        current CPU, memory usage and number of bearers open. On
        reaching the low congestion threshold, based on the ARP, high
        priority calls are accepted and those with a lower priority
        are rejected. Once the high threshold is reached all new
        calls are rejected.

        2. Buffering agent, the SGW buffers the data packets in the
        downlink direction till the downlink path/peer information is
        ready. It buffers all packets coming from any gateway based
        on the default/configured values of the buffer size, discard
        period and number of packets. Packets will be buffered on a
        per bearer basis and retrieved in the order it was buffered
        using the handle given by the buffering agent initially. If
        the buffer is full then no more bearers will be accepted.
