        DESCRIPTION
                "This module provides a subtree to define OIDs so that
                various routing 'policies' used by Cisco routers can be
                expressed. This module defines only this 'policy' OID
                space and doesn't define any other object.

                As an example, these OIDs are required by at least the
                following MIB objects: inetCidrRoutePolicy
                ( IP-FORWARD-MIB, RFC4292 ) and
                mplsL3VpnVrfRteInetCidrPolicy ( MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB
                RCS4382).  Both of these objects are defined as OBJECT
                IDENTIFIERs without any defined semantics, to
                differentiate between multiple entries to the same
                destination in the tables inetCidrRoutePolicyTable and
                mplsL3VpnVrfRteInetCidrTable.  These two objects
                utilise a generalised notion of 'policy' defined in
                this module.

                The table inetCidrRouteTable of IP-FORWARD-MIB may list
                multiple paths pointing out of (either):

                * different interfaces with the same next-hop
                        ipv6 route 2003::/64 interface gig0/0 2222::1
                        ipv6 route 2003::/64 interface gig0/1 2222::1
                * different interfaces with no next-hop
                        ipv6 route 2003::/64 interface gig0/0
                        ipv6 route 2003::/64 interface gig0/1

                2003::/64 and 2222::1 represent an IPv6 route-prefix
                and IPv6 next-hop respectively.

                If these interfaces were in different zones, then the
                'InetAddressIPv6z' type next-hop could distinguish
                them. If they are in the same zone, then the two
                interfaces refer to the same link.

                The indices of inetCidrRouteTable are:
                        inetCidrRouteDestType
                        inetCidrRouteDest
                        inetCidrRoutePfxLen
                        inetCidrRoutePolicy
                        inetCidrRouteNextHopType
                        inetCidrRouteNextHop

                The inetCidrRoutePolicy object, when instantiated with a
                value from crpPolicyIfIndex, allows us to distinguish
                the routing table entries mentioned in the examples
                above.

                crpPolicyIfIndex.i is defined such that each
                inetCidrRouteTable entry for which the instance of
                inetCidrRoutePolicy has this value, is associated with
                ifIndex=i, and thereby is distinct for any
                inetCidrRouteTable entry associated with
                ifIndex=j.  Note that the value of inetCidrRoutePolicy
                for the latter would be crpPolicyIfIndex.j.

                This set of policies is appropriate only if an ifIndex
                value is sufficient to distinguish between routes. "
