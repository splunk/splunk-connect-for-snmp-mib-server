	-- This data type, which has the same semantics as the rowStatus
	-- textual convention used in SNMPv2, is used to add and
	-- delete entries from a table.
	-- The tables in this MIB allow a subset of the functionality
	-- provided by the rowStatus textual convention.  In particular
	-- row creation is allowed using only the createAndGo method.

	-- That is, when adding entries to this table, this object
	-- must be set to createAndGo(4).  The instance identifier
	-- for this object will define the values of the columns
	-- that make up the index.

	-- In the same PDU, the appropriate remaining columns
	-- of that row must be set as well.  The agent
	-- will immediately set the value of this object to
	-- active(1) if the row is correct.  If not, the agent
	-- will refuse the SET request and return an
	-- error code.

	-- To modify an existing entry, it must be removed
	-- and another entry with the desired changes added.
	-- To remove an entry, set the value of this object
	-- to destroy(6).
