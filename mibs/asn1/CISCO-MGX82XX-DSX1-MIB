		"This variable describes the  variety  of  Zero
		Code  Suppression  used  on  the link, which in
		turn affects a number of its characteristics.

		dsx1JBZS(1): refers the Jammed  Bit  Zero suppression
		             in  which  the  AT&T specification of at
                             least one pulse every 8 bit periods is 
                             literally  implemented  by forcing a pulse
                             in bit 8 of each channel.  Thus, only seven 
                             bits per  chan- nel, or 1.344 Mbps, is available
                             for data.

		dsx1B8ZS(2): refers to the use of a specified  pattern
		             of  normal  bits  and  bipolar violations
		             which are used to replace a sequence  of  eight
                             zero bits.

		E1 links, with or without CRC, use dsx1HDB3  or
        	dsx1AMI.

        	dsx1AMI(4): refers to a mode wherein no  zero  code
                            suppression  is  present  and the line encoding
                            does not solve the problem directly. In this
        	            application, the higher layer must provide data
        	            which meets or exceeds the  pulse  density
        	            requirements, such as inverting HDLC data.

		The default value for T1 is 'dsx1JBZS' and for E1 
		is 'dsx1HDB3'.

		 9 - 120 ohms (E1 line only (DB-15))
		
		The default value for T1 is 1, for E1, if the connector

		For FRSM-2CT3, the line length of DS1 has no meaning
