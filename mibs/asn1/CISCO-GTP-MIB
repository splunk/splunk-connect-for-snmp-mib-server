    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module manages the GPRS Tunnelling Protocol
        (GTP) on GGSN and SGSN.

        GPRS provides wireless access to packet data network on
        the GSM infrastructure.

        The following diagram illustrates a simplified GPRS
        logical architecture with the name of inter-node
        interface:

        GTP is the protocol between GSN nodes (GSN peers) in
        the GPRS backbone network. It includes both the GTP
        signalling and data transfer procedures.

        GTP is used both on the Gn interface, i.e. the interface
        between GSN peers with in a PLMN, and the Gp
        interface between GSN peers in different PLMNs.

        SGSN is the serving GPRS support node, it responsible 
        for the delivery of data packets from and to the MS 
        within its service area.

        GGSN is the gateway GPRS support node, it provides 
        interworking with external PDN and is connected with 
        SGSNs via an IP-based GPRS backbone network.

        The GTP protocol is implemented only by SGSNs and GGSN.

        A PDP Context is an information set maintained by MS 
        and GSNs which describes the mobile wireless service
        call or session.

        A Qos Profile is associated with each PDP context which
        defines multiple attributes like precedence, delay, 
        reliability, peak throughput and mean throughput.
        Based on the precedence, delay and mean throughput an
        user is classified into one of the three Qos classes:
        Best Effort, Normal and Premium.

        Mean throughput is measured at the Gi and R reference 
        points in units of octets per second. It specifies the 
        average rate at which data is expected to be 
        transferred across the GPRS network during the 
        remaining lifetime of an activated PDP context.

        A MAP converting GSN is responsible for converting GTP
        messages to and from MAP messages.  This helps in the
        communication with HLR.

        Added 'gtpdirector' to the enumeration of cGtpService.

        The APN identifies whether the network is corporate 
        or service provider network.  

        The Single Access point feature enables the
        service provider to add new access-points to the GGSN
        without having to provision the HLR. The requests are
        sent by the SGSN to the same virtual APN. A virtual
        APN is not associated with any actual physical
        network.  The GGSN processes the request and forwards
        the packet to the appropriate access-point that is
        specified in the PCO. This feature is supported only
        in Cisco GGSNs.

        The purpose of the GTP-Director is to provide a
        mechanism for service providers using non-Cisco GGSN
        to use the Single APN feature.

        The GTP-Director also provides load balancing, using 
        round robin mechanism, across GGSNs.  The
        Cisco GGSNs may use the GTP-Director, but is not
        necessary as they can use IOS-SLB ( Server Load
        Balancing )."

    DESCRIPTION
        "This table identifies the paths established on a GSN. The
        path may be established between a GGSN and SGSN or GGSN 
        and charging gateway or GGSN and MAP converting GSN.

        The path between GGSN and charging gateway is established
        when the charging gateway is configured on the GGSN.

        The path between GGSN and MAP converting GSN is established
        when the MAP converting GSN is configured on the GGSN.

        The path between a GGSN and SGSN is established in the 
        following series of steps:

        1. When Mobile System (MS) wants service, it sends packets
           to a SGSN with specific APN.

        2. SGSN uses the DNS to resolve this APN to the IP address
           of the GGSN which is the designated as the gateway to
           this APN.

        3. SGSN establishes a path to the GGSN using GTP protocol.

        4. The SGSN and GGSN peer maintains path by sending echo
           request message to each other. If one side fails in echo
           reply for certain times, the other side will send a
           trap to NMS. A SGSN can have multiple GGSN as peers,
           while a GGSN can have multiple SGSN peers, depending
           on routing path. Moreover, a GSN can have more than one 
           path to a peer, each of which will have a unique port."
