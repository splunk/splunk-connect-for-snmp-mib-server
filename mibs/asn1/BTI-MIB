-- OSS Integration 
-- BTI Systems Inc. can provide customers with direct access to 
-- network element SNMP MIBs for use for integration to OSS systems. 
-- Customers must note the following caveats:
--
-- 1) Performance: The BTI Systems Inc. MIBS are performance tested for
-- use with the BTI Systems proNX 900 Node Controller and proNX 9000 
-- Network Manager. Customers are responsible for conducting their 
-- own testing to ensure that the BTI Systems Inc. NE interfaces meet 
-- the needs of their proposed usage. BTI Systems Inc. makes no
-- guarantees that any proposed usage will meet customer requirements.
--
-- 2) Changes between releases: BTI Systems Inc. SNMP MIBs are subject 
-- to change as support for new functionality is introduced. BTI  
-- Systems Inc. strives to maintain backward compatibility of MIBs 
-- across releases but this is not guaranteed and BTI Systems Inc. 
-- reserves the right to deprecate or remove support for obsolete 
-- MIB elements. OSS integrators must be careful not to rely on 
-- functionality that is marked as deprecated as it may be unsupported 
-- in a subsequent release. Customers that integrate directly to BTI 
-- Systems Inc. MIBs are responsible for all OSS development and 
-- integration testing that may arise from MIB changes between releases 
-- of BTI Systems Inc. software.
