SntpClientOperModes ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A SNTP client may operate in one of several modes.
    
         -------------------------------------------------------
         --  Any or all of these modes MAY be supported on a
         --  device.
         -------------------------------------------------------

            disabled
              - SNTP is not operational.  No SNTP requests are sent
                from the device nor are any received SNTP messages
                processed.

            unicast
              - SNTP operates in a point-to-point fashion.  A unicast 
                client sends a request to a designated server
                at its unicast address and expects a reply from which
                it can determine the time and, optionally, the 
                round-trip delay and local clock offset relative to the 
                server.

            multicast
              - SNTP operates in point-to-multipoint fashion.  The
                SNTP server uses a multicast group address to send
                unsolicited SNTP messages to clients.  The client
                listens on this address and sends no requests for
                updates.

            broadcast
              - This operates in the same manner as multicast mode
                but uses an IP local broadcast address instead of a 
                multicast address.  The broadcast address is scoped
                to a single subnet, while a multicast address has 
                Internet wide scope.

            anycast
              - SNTP operates in a multipoint-to-point fashion.  The
                SNTP client sends a request to a designated IPv4 or
                IPv6 local broadcast address or multicast group
                address. One or more anycast servers reply with their 
                individual unicast addresses. The client binds to the 
                first one received, then continues operation in 
                unicast mode."

          success 
            - The SNTP operation was successful and the system time
              was updated.

          requestTimedOut
            - A directed SNTP request timed out without receiving a 
              response from the SNTP server.

          badDateEncoded
            - The time provided by the SNTP server is not valid.

         versionNotSupported
            - The SNTP version supported by the server is not compatible
              with the version supported by the client.

         serverUnsychronized
            - The SNTP server is not synchronized with its peers.  This
              is indicated via the 'leap indicator' field on the SNTP 
              message."
