                "An RFC 1766-style language tag, with all alphabetic 
                characters converted to lowercase.  This restriction is 
                intended to make the lexical ordering imposed by SNMP 
                useful when applied to language tags.  Note that it is 
                theoretically possible for a valid language tag to 
                exceed the allowed length of this syntax, and thus be 
                impossible to represent with this syntax.  Sampling of 
                language tags in current use on the Internet suggests 
                that this limit does not pose a serious problem in 
                practice."
