    DESCRIPTION "
      This module contains definitions for performance monitoring of the
      ATM layer and it's circuits.

      This MIB module contains the following tables:
        ATM VPL 15 Minute Current Table
        ATM VPL 15 Minute Interval Table
        ATM VPL 1 Hour Current Table
        ATM VPL 1 Hour Interval Table
        ATM VPL Stat Table
        ATM VPL Stat Counter Table

        ATM VCL 15 Minute Current Table
        ATM VCL 15 Minute Interval Table
        ATM VCL 1 Hour Current Table
        ATM VCL 1 Hour Interval Table
        ATM VCL Stat Table
        ATM VCL Stat Counter Table

        nncDepthOfHistoricalStrata

    These tables are heavily influenced by the definition of VPL/VCL
    described in rfc1695, and by the statistic table definitions described
    for Sonet in rfc1595. The number of intervals supported is dependent
    upon resource availibility on any given product, but should nominally
    be 32. To avoid building in massive amounts of storage, some products
    may adopt a bulk collection scheme. 

    Intervals:
    Statistics on the performance of VPL/VCLs are collected over a
	historical stratum of up to a maximum of M intervals. The value of M
	is a function of a product's storage capability.

	The intervals can be either 15 minutes or 1 hour and are aligned to
	the quarter or one hour, respectively, of a wall clock. The current
	interval spans back to the last 15 minute or 1 hour tick on the wall
	clock. Continuing along the timeline from that point is the most
	recently completed interval and has an index of 1. The previous
	interval has an index of 2 and so on. Note that the oldest interval
	may be incomplete since the statistic collection may have been
	enabled offset to the quarter or one hour tick.

	  interval

     
    Counters:
	The following is understood for each counter in this MIB:
	  - OAM cells are included in counts
	  - idle and unassigned cells are not counted
	  - valid cells are those that have passed HEC and have assigned VPI/VCI
	  - admitted cells have a connection
	  
     This module also contains definitions for performance monitoring of 
     Virtual Path Aggregation (VPA) - also known as VCC to VPC Traffic
     Aggregation - and implemented as Shaped Trunk Group.
     Only egress VPA statistics are provided.
      
     The following tables have been added :
        ATM VPA Short (15 minutes) Current Table
        ATM VPA Short (15 Minutes) Interval Table
        ATM VPA Long  (1 Hour) Current Table
        ATM VPA Long  (1 Hour) Interval Table
 
     Intervals:
     two 15-minute intervals are provided : current and previous
     two 1-hour intervals are provided : current and previous.

                                statistics for a particular VPL. 
                                
                                By default, 1 Hour statistics are not
                                gathered. In order to enable gathering of
                                these statistics, a row must be created.

                                The semantics of nncVpl1HourCurrentRowStatus
                                is the same as the definition of RowStatus
                                in rfc1443 with the following constraints.

                                1. Creation is done in one step, that is, by
                                   setting the nncVpl1HourCurrentRowStatus
                                   column to createAndGo. Setting the column
                                   to createAndWait will return wrongValue.
                                2. The VPI specified in the instance must
                                   be an endpoint that is currently used in
                                   a VPL otherwise the agent will return
                                   return inconsistentValue and no row is
                                   created.
                                3. If the maximum number of rows (an agent
                                   limitation) has been reached, 
                                   resourceUnavailable is returned and no
                                   row is created.
                                4. Creation of a current row will also enable
                                   the corresponding interval table whose
                                   rows will be created when intervals are
                                   completed.
                                5. Statistics collection is disabled by
                                   setting the column to destroy. This will
                                   also remove all corresponding rows in
                                   the interval table.

                                statistics for a particular VCL. 
                                
                                By default, 1 Hour statistics are not
                                gathered. In order to enable gathering of
                                these statistics, a row must be created.

                                The semantics of nncVcl1HourCurrentRowStatus
                                is the same as the definition of RowStatus
                                in rfc1443 with the following constraints.

                                1. Creation is done in one step, that is, by
                                   setting the nncVcl1HourCurrentRowStatus
                                   column to createAndGo. Setting the column
                                   to createAndWait will return wrongValue.
                                2. The VCI specified in the instance must
                                   be an endpoint that is currently used in
                                   a VCL otherwise the agent will return
                                   return inconsistentValue and no row is
                                   created.
                                3. If the maximum number of rows (an agent
                                   limitation) has been reached, 
                                   resourceUnavailable is returned and no
                                   row is created.
                                4. Creation of a current row will also enable
                                   the corresponding interval table whose
                                   rows will be created when intervals are
                                   completed.
                                5. Statistics collection is disabled by
                                   setting the column to destroy. This will
                                   also remove all corresponding rows in
                                   the interval table.

--      A message was sent out on 1996.04.03 to electronically review

--      It was the consensus of the review team that this file is 
--      acceptable with the indicated modifications
--
--      Comments:

--      From: James Watt (96/4/7)
--        Content/Usability
--        1) The module name should be NNC-ATM-STATISTICS-MIB (note the extra
--           hyphens) to match the rules in SQP0053,
-- 
--        2) I would move the block of comments before the
--           nncVpl15MinCurrentTable into the DESCRIPTION clause for the module
--           so they get retained even when some "mib munger" tool throws away
--           all of the comments
-- 
--        3) I would have IMPORTed atVplVpi from RFC 1695 and used it in the
--           INDEX clause to make the coupling between the tables more clear to
--           a "dumb" mechanical tool, just the way ifIndex was imported.  This
--           goes for all VPI indexed tables and for VCI tables too, although
--           you need atmVclVci, etc.
--        
--        4) The DESCRIPTION clause for nncVpl15MinCurrentEntry could really
--           use a case diagram to show how the counters add up (or don't add
--           up).
--        
--        5) In nncVpl15MinCurrentClp0And1InCells, does "admitted" mean
--           anything different than "received" ?  Also, does "...to the UPC
--           function.." exclude NPC ?  If not, perhaps using "traffic
--           policing" (as is done) later would be more general
--        
--        6) Do the cell counts include OAM cells ?
--        
--        7) What does "valid cells" mean  in each case ?
--        
--        8) I assume in all cases Idle and Unassigned cells are not counted ?
--        
--        9) In the description clauses the for the IntervalEntry's, there
--           should be a comment about the alignment of the intervals with a
--           reference back to the MODULE's description for more info.
--        
--        10) DOes nncDepthOfHistoricalStrata apply to 15min or 1h or both ?
--            To vcls or vpls or both ?  I can imagine when I would want
--            different values for vcls and vpls as there are a lot more of
--            one than the other...
--        
--        11) In the MODULE-COMPLIANCE invocation, you need to refer to the
--            Interval Groups
--        
--        Editorial
--        a) the IMPORTS clause could get formatted to match the V2 idiom
--           (e.g. see RFC1573),
--        b) the DESCRIPTION text should start under the R in DESCRIPTION
--        c) (a) and (b) make one wish we had a "pretty-printing" tool...

--
--      comments by email
--      from James Watt (5/15/96)
--              1) In SNMPv2, if an object is an index term, i.e. it is
--                  mentioned in the INDEX clause, in general it _must_ be
--                  not-accessible (see RFC 1902 Section 7.7 first 3 of the 
--                  last 4 paragraphs).  SMICng will tell you this when you
--                  run it.
--              2) If it is simply free-running counters ,I would call it the
--                 VxlStatsTable...  It isn't totals, Accumulated doesn't add
--                  any value that I can see and Raw is just weird.
--              3) when Counters are "reset" and
--                  what their initial value is/may be defined by the SMI
--                  (e.g. see RFC 1902 7.1.6).
