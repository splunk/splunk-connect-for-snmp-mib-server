--  System group

--  Objects common to all platforms
--
--  Configuration save objects.  These objects are used by the network
--  management application to save configuration changes into the
--  persistant store.  There are 2 stores on the device; a primary and
--  a secondary.

            	"When this object is set, the device will copy the contents
		of the configuration database to a buffer and save it to the 
		persistant store specified by the value of the object.  The 
		save is	performed asynchronously, and the snmp agent will
                continue to respond to both gets and sets while the save is
                taking place.  A network management application may use the
		intelSaveStatus object to determine when the asynchronous
		save operation has completed."
