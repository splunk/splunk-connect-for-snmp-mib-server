    DESCRIPTION
            "The MIB module is defined to configure the Announcements
             feature on the Media Gateway Card.

             The Media Gateway Card will have the capability to 
             play pre-recorded local announcements in switched 
             VoIP solutions only.  Under the control of a call agent,
             announcements can be played in either direction over 
             existing connections (calls) or towards the Time
             Division Multiplexed (TDM) network on a TDM endpoint
             that is terminated on the the Media Gateway Card.

             A large number of different announcements may be cached
             on the Media Gateway Card for immediate play out.
             A persistent announcement store, called the Announcement
             file server, will exist in the packet network and hold
             all the announcements in the network. Announcements will 
             be downloaded on demand as announcement files from
             the configured announcement store. Downloaded announcement
             files will be stored on the Media Gateway Card as either 
             'permanent' or 'dynamic' announcement files. Permanent
             files on the Media Gateway Card are exempt from being
             refreshed, replaced, or removed without explicit
             provisioning actions.  Dynamic announcement files will
             not persist across resets.  Permanent announcement files
             will be reloaded, if possible, following a reset. Dynamic
             announcement files are automatically 'aged'. 'Aged'
             files are re-fetched from the Announcement file server.
             Dynamic Announcement files can be replaced on the 
             Media Gateway Card if the Announcement memory on the
             card is full and additional Announcement files are to 
             be downloaded. The file(s) to be replaced will be
             determined according to some Least Recently Used(LRU)
             algorithm.
             
             Announcements can be played over established connections
             and unconnected TDM endpoints in any encoding supported
             by the Media Gateway Card in its current configuration.
             Announcement files must be encoded in G.729a to be
             played on G.729ab connections or, if G.729ab has been
             chosen as the preferred codec, unconnected endpoints.

             The Announcement file server will reside on an IP network 
             reachable from the Media Gateway Card using TFTP.
             The user will configure the Announcement file server 
             node name on the the Media Gateway Card.
             The Announcement file server will have a 'main' file
             directory for Announcements. If the Announcement prefix
             path is configured to begin with a '/' then the 
             directory is absolute. If the prefix path is configured
             to begin without a '/' then it will be relative to the
             default TFTP server directory. If no prefix path is
             configured then the Announcement 'main' directory and
             the TFTP default directory will be the same. The user
             must configure subdirectories within the main
             Announcement directory for each encoding that
             Announcements may be played in. These subdirectories must
             be of the following names: 'g711u', 'g711a', 'g726_40k',
             'g726_32k', 'g726_24k', 'g726_16k', 'g729_a',
             'g7231_high_rate', 'g7231_a_high_rate', 'g7231_low_rate', 
             'g7231_a_low_rate'.


             The Media Gateway Card maintains an Announcement cache in
             resident memory. The cache is populated on demand with
             dynamic files or provisioned with permanent files. That
             is to say that when an Announcement is requested to be
             played it will first be retrieved from the Announcement
             file server and placed in the on-board Announcement cache.
             Subsequent requests for the same Announcement will not
             require retrieval of the Announcement file from the
             Announcement file server.  Note that an Announcement in
             one encoding is a different file than the same
             Announcement in a different encoding.

             The 'Announcement aging' policy is provisionable for 
             dynamic files. Once a dynamic Announcement has 'aged'
             in the on-board cache it will be 'refreshed' by being 
             retrieved again from the Announcement file server.  
             The age time determines the maximum time before an updated
             Announcement file is automatically propagated to the card.
             Shorter age times will result in more frequent file
             server access. Changing the 'age' time does not affect
             the age times of dynamic Announcement files currently
             loaded. However, once these files are refreshed, they
             will then use the new 'age' time.

             Announcements may also be provisioned as 'permanent'.  
             A permanent Announcement will be fetched from the 
             Announcement file server and 'frozen' in the Media
             Gateway Card Announcement cache.  Permanent
             Announcements will be excluded from aging (and being
             automatically refreshed) and excluded from being 
             replaced if the Announcement cache becomes full.  
             Permanent Announcements can only be removed from the
             cache explicitly by user through command line
             interface or through a Network Manager. If the Media
             Gateway Card is reset, permanent Announcements will be
             re-fetched from the Announcement file server as soon
             as the card becomes active. The Announcement encoding
             must be specified when provisioning permanent
             Announcements.
