         "This object will either be considered NULL
          (i.e. non usable) or non NULL (usable or activated

          This object must be compatible with the 
          vismDsx1TonePlanRegion object above, where both objects 
          must either be NULL or where both objects must be non NULL.
          The vismTonePlanTable table consists of 32 slots which 
          are configurable (provisionable) followed by a release 
          dependent number of slots for built-in entries which are 
          not configurable, but loaded from values stored in the
          internal firmware of the release. As releases are continued,
          the number of built-in slots will typically increase.  
          The total number of slots in this table consists of the sum 
          of the 32 provisionable slots plus an unspecified
          number of built-in slots and the built-in number and this 
          sum represents the size of this table.

          are considered to be a NULL object, its behavior and
          contents are described in paragraph five of this
          description block.
 
          The allowed range and contents of this object in the non
          NULL case is the same as the tonePlanVersionNumber object
          in the vismTonePlanTable. This object will thus consist of 
          a non zero numeric value.  And this object plus the 
          vismDsx1TonePlanRegion object above, must exactly match 
          an existing valid entry in the vismTonePlanTable.
 
          In the case where this object is NULL, this object will 
          consist of a zero numeric value.  A NULL value for this 
          object will make the vismDsx1RingingTO, vismDsx1RingBackTO,
