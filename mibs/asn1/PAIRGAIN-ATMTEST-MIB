pgoamLoopbackAddress OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX     OCTET STRING (SIZE (16))
    MAX-ACCESS read-write
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
	  "Specifies the local ATM device’s ATM address.
	 Other ATM devices use the ATM address to
	   identify this local ATM device as the device that is being
	   requested to loopback the OAM Loopback cell."

pgoamLoopbackTable OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX     SEQUENCE OF PgoamLoopbackEntry
    MAX-ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A table of OAM loopback request entries."
    ::= { pgATMTestMIBObjects 2 }

pgoamLoopbackEntry OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX     PgoamLoopbackEntry
    MAX-ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A OAM loopback request entry.

	Each entry in the table is uniquely identified by
	ifIndex, VPI and VCI.

	To start a test, use NMS to create
	the associated instance of the row status and row owner objects.
	Also use NMS to modify the default values for the other configuration
	objects if the defaults are not appropriate.

        Once you have used NMS to create the appropriate instance of all of the configuration
        objects, either by an explicit SNMP
        set request or by default, use NMS to set the row status
        to active to initiate the request.  Note that this entire
        procedure can be initiated using a single set request that
        specifies a row status of createAndGo as well as the
        valid values for the non-defaulted configuration objects.

 once the OAM test sequence has been activated, it can be aborted
	by setting RowStatus from active to notInService.

        Once the test sequence completes, the NMS should
        retrieve the values of the status objects of interest and
 then delete the entry.  To prevent old
        entries from clogging the table, whenever a new OAM loopback
	test is requested on a VPI VCI, the old VPI VCI entry
        is deleted and the entries
	marked expired are also deleted."
