          The list, consisting of more than one index, allows each PME

          "Desired EFMCu port 'net' (as seen across MII) Data Rate in

	  depending on the values of efmCuTargetWorstCaseMode and
	  efmCuTargetCurrentConditionMode.

          In case of PAF, this object represents a sum of individual PME
          data rates, modified to compensate for fragmentation and
          64/65B framing overhead (e.g. target data rate of 10Mbps
          shall allow lossless transmission of full-duplex 10Mbps
          Ethernet frame stream with minimal inter-frame gap).

          The value is limited above by 100Mbps as this is the max
          burst rate across MII for EFMCu ports.

          The value between 1 and 100000 indicates that the total data
          rate (ifSpeed) of the EFMCu port after initialization should
          be equal to the target data rate or less, if the target data
          rate cannot be achieved under spectral restrictions specified
          by efmCuAdminProfile/efmCuPmeAdminProfile and with desired SNR
          margin. In case the copper environment allows to achieve
          higher total data rate than specified by the target, the
          excess capability SHALL be converted to additional SNR margin
          and spread evenly across all active PMEs assigned to the (PCS)
          port.

          The value of 999999 means that the target data rate is not
          fixed and should be set to the maximum attainable rate during
          initialization (Best Effort), under specified spectral
          restrictions and with desired SNR Margin.

          This object is read-write for the -O subtype EFMCu ports

          with the error inconsistentValue, if the link is Up or
