                     "An entry in the VPL table.  This entry is
                      used to model a bi-directional VPL.
                      To create a VPL at an ATM interface,
                      either of the following procedures are used:

                      Negotiated VPL establishment

                    (1) The management application creates
                        a VPL entry in the atmVplTable
                        by setting atmVplRowStatus to createAndWait(5).
                        This may fail for the following reasons:
                        - The selected VPI value is unavailable,
                        - The selected VPI value is in use.
                        Otherwise, the agent creates a row and
                        reserves the VPI value on that port.

                    (2) The manager selects an existing row(s) in the
                        atmTrafficDescrParamTable,
                        thereby, selecting a set of self-consistent
                        ATM traffic parameters and the QoS Class
                        for receive and transmit directions of the VPL.

                   (2a) If no suitable row(s) in the
                        atmTrafficDescrParamTable exists,
                        the manager must create a new row(s)
                        in that table.

                   (2b) The manager characterizes the VPL's traffic
                        parameters through setting the
                        atmVplReceiveTrafficDescrIndex and the
                        atmVplTransmitTrafficDescrIndex values
                        in the VPL table, which point to the rows
                        containing desired ATM traffic parameter values
                        in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable.  The agent
                        will check the availability of resources and
                        may refuse the request.

                    (3) The manager activates the VPL by setting the
                        the atmVplRowStatus to active(1).
                        If this set is successful, the agent has
                        reserved the resources to satisfy the requested
                        traffic parameter values and the QoS Class
                        for that VPL.
                    (4) If the VPL terminates a VPC in the ATM host
                        or switch, the manager turns on the
                        atmVplAdminStatus to up(1) to turn the VPL
                        traffic flow on.  Otherwise, the
                        atmVpCrossConnectTable  must be used
                        to cross-connect the VPL to another VPL(s)
                        in an ATM switch or network.

                      One-Shot VPL Establishment

                      A VPL may also be established in one step by a
                      set-request with all necessary VPL parameter
                      values and atmVplRowStatus set to createAndGo(4).

                      In contrast to the negotiated VPL establishment
                      which allows for detailed error checking
                      (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked to
                      particular resource acquisition failures),
                      the one-shot VPL establishment
                      performs the setup on one operation but
                      does not have the advantage of step-wise
                      error checking.

                      VPL Retirement

                      A VPL is released by setting atmVplRowStatus to
                      destroy(6), and the agent may release all
                      associated resources."

                      used to model a bi-directional VCL.
                      To create a VCL at an ATM interface,
                      either of the following procedures are used:

                      Negotiated VCL establishment

                    (1) The management application creates
                        a VCL entry in the atmVclTable
                        by setting atmVclRowStatus to createAndWait(5).
                        This may fail for the following reasons:
                        - The selected VPI/VCI values are unavailable,
                        - The selected VPI/VCI values are in use.
                        Otherwise, the agent creates a row and
                        reserves the VPI/VCI values on that port.

                    (2) The manager selects an existing row(s) in the
                        atmTrafficDescrParamTable,
                        thereby, selecting a set of self-consistent
                        ATM traffic parameters and the QoS Class
                        for receive and transmit directions of the VCL.

                   (2a) If no suitable row(s) in the
                        atmTrafficDescrParamTable exists,
                        the manager must create a new row(s)
                        in that table.

                   (2b) The manager characterizes the VCL's traffic
                        parameters through setting the
                        atmVclReceiveTrafficDescrIndex and the
                        atmVclTransmitTrafficDescrIndex values
                        in the VCL table, which point to the rows
                        containing desired ATM traffic parameter values
                        in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable.  The agent
                        will check the availability of resources and
                        may refuse the request.

                    (3) The manager activates the VCL by setting the
                        the atmVclRowStatus to active(1).
                        If this set is successful, the agent has
                        reserved the resources to satisfy the requested
                        traffic parameter values and the QoS Class
                        for that VCL.
                    (4) If the VCL terminates a VCC in the ATM host
                        or switch, the manager turns on the
                        atmVclAdminStatus to up(1) to turn the VCL
                        traffic flow on.  Otherwise, the
                        atmVcCrossConnectTable  must be used
                        to cross-connect the VCL to another VCL(s)
                        in an ATM switch or network.

                     One-Shot VCL Establishment

                     A VCL may also be established in one step by a
                     set-request with all necessary VCL parameter
                     values and atmVclRowStatus set to createAndGo(4).

                     In contrast to the negotiated VCL establishment
                     which allows for detailed error checking
                     (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked to
                     particular resource acquisition failures),
                     the one-shot VCL establishment
                     performs the setup on one operation but
                     does not have the advantage of step-wise
                     error checking.

                     VCL Retirement

                     A VCL is released by setting atmVclRowStatus to
                     destroy(6), and the agent may release all
                     associated resources."

                     "An entry in the ATM VP Cross Connect table.
                      This entry is used to model a bi-directional
                      ATM VP cross-connect which cross-connects
                      two VPLs.

                      Step-wise Procedures to set up a VP Cross-connect

                      Once the entries in the atmVplTable are created,
                      the following procedures are used
                      to cross-connect the VPLs together.
                     (1) The manager obtains a unique
                         atmVpCrossConnectIndex by reading the
                         atmVpCrossConnectIndexNext object.

                     (2) Next, the manager creates a set of one
                         or more rows in the ATM VP Cross Connect
                         Table, one for each cross-connection between
                         two VPLs.  Each row is indexed by the ATM
                         interface port numbers and VPI values of the
                         two ends of that cross-connection.
                         This set of rows specifies the topology of the
                         VPC cross-connect and is identified by a single
                         value of atmVpCrossConnectIndex.

                      Negotiated VP Cross-Connect Establishment

                    (2a) The manager creates a row in this table by
                         setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus to
                         createAndWait(5).  The agent checks the
                         requested topology and the mutual sanity of
                         the ATM traffic parameters and
                         QoS Classes, i.e., the row creation fails if:
                         - the requested topology is not supported
                           by the agent,
                         - the traffic/QoS parameter values
                           associated with the requested row are
                           incompatible with those of already existing
                           rows for this VP cross-connect.
                         [For example, for setting up
                         a point-to-point VP cross-connect, the
                         ATM traffic parameters in the receive direction
                         of a VPL at the low end of the cross-connect
                         must equal to the traffic parameters in the
                         transmit direction of the other VPL at the
                         high end of the cross-connect,
                         otherwise, the row creation fails.]
                         The agent also checks for internal errors
                         in building the cross-connect.

                         The atmVpCrossConnectIndex values in the
                         corresponding atmVplTable rows are filled
                         in by the agent at this point.

                    (2b) The manager promotes the row in the
                         atmVpCrossConnectTable by setting
                         atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus to active(1).  If
                         this set is successful, the agent has reserved
                         the resources specified by the ATM traffic
                         parameter and QoS Class values
                         for each direction of the VP cross-connect
                         in an ATM switch or network.

                     (3) The manager sets the
                         atmVpCrossConnectAdminStatus to up(1) in all
                         rows of this VP cross-connect to turn the
                         traffic flow on.


                      One-Shot VP Cross-Connect Establishment

                      A VP cross-connect may also be established in
                      one step by a set-request with all necessary
                      parameter values and atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus
                      set to createAndGo(4).

                      In contrast to the negotiated VP cross-connect
                      establishment which allows for detailed error
                      checking (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked
                      to particular resource acquisition failures),

                      VP Cross-Connect Retirement

                      A VP cross-connect identified by a particular
                      value of atmVpCrossConnectIndex is released by:

                     (1) Setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus of all
                         rows identified by this value of
                         atmVpCrossConnectIndex to destroy(6).
                         The agent may release all
                         associated resources, and the
                         atmVpCrossConnectIndex values in the
                         corresponding atmVplTable row are removed.
                         Note that a situation when only a subset of
                         the associated rows are deleted corresponds
                         to a VP topology change.

                     (2) After deletion of the appropriate
                         atmVpCrossConnectEntries, the manager may
                         set atmVplRowStatus to destroy(6) the
                         associated VPLs.  The agent releases
                         the resources and removes the associated
                         rows in the atmVplTable.

                      VP Cross-connect Reconfiguration

                      At the discretion of the agent, a VP
                      cross-connect may be reconfigured by
                      adding and/or deleting leafs to/from
                      the VP topology as per the VP cross-connect
                      establishment/retirement procedures.
                      Reconfiguration of traffic/QoS parameter
                      values requires release of the VP cross-connect
                      before those parameter values may by changed
                      for individual VPLs."

                         two VCLs.  Each row is indexed by the ATM
                         interface port numbers and VPI/VCI values of
                         the two ends of that cross-connection.
                         This set of rows specifies the topology of the
                         VCC cross-connect and is identified by a single
                         value of atmVcCrossConnectIndex.

                      Negotiated VC Cross-Connect Establishment

                    (2a) The manager creates a row in this table by
                         setting atmVcCrossConnectRowStatus to
                         createAndWait(5).  The agent checks the
                         requested topology and the mutual sanity of
                         the ATM traffic parameters and
                         QoS Classes, i.e., the row creation fails if:
                         - the requested topology is not supported
                           by the agent,
                         - the traffic/QoS parameter values
                           associated with the requested row are
                           incompatible with those of already existing
                           rows for this VC cross-connect.
                         [For example, for setting up
                         a point-to-point VC cross-connect, the
                         ATM traffic parameters in the receive direction
                         of a VCL at the low end of the cross-connect
                         must equal to the traffic parameters in the
                         transmit direction of the other VCL at the
                         high end of the cross-connect,
                         otherwise, the row creation fails.]
                         The agent also checks for internal errors
                         in building the cross-connect.

                         The atmVcCrossConnectIndex values in the
                         corresponding atmVclTable rows are filled
                         in by the agent at this point.

                    (2b) The manager promotes the row in the
                         atmVcCrossConnectTable by setting
                         atmVcCrossConnectRowStatus to active(1).  If
                         this set is successful, the agent has reserved
                         the resources specified by the ATM traffic
                         parameter and QoS Class values
                         for each direction of the VC cross-connect
                         in an ATM switch or network.

                     (3) The manager sets the
                         atmVcCrossConnectAdminStatus to up(1)
                         in all rows of this VC cross-connect to
                         turn the traffic flow on.


                      One-Shot VC Cross-Connect Establishment

                      A VC cross-connect may also be established in
                      one step by a set-request with all necessary
                      parameter values and atmVcCrossConnectRowStatus
                      set to createAndGo(4).

                      In contrast to the negotiated VC cross-connect
                      establishment which allows for detailed error
                      checking i.e., set errors are explicitly linked to
                      particular resource acquisition failures), the
                      one-shot VC cross-connect establishment
                      performs the setup on one operation but does
                      not have the advantage of step-wise error
                      checking.

                      VC Cross-Connect Retirement

                      A VC cross-connect identified by a particular
                      value of atmVcCrossConnectIndex is released by:

                     (1) Setting atmVcCrossConnectRowStatus of all rows
                         identified by this value of
                         atmVcCrossConnectIndex to destroy(6).
                         The agent may release all
                         associated resources, and the
                         atmVcCrossConnectIndex values in the
                         corresponding atmVclTable row are removed.
                         Note that a situation when only a subset of
                         the associated rows are deleted corresponds
                         to a VC topology change.

                     (2) After deletion of the appropriate
                         atmVcCrossConnectEntries, the manager may
                         set atmVclRowStatus to destroy(6) the
                         associated VCLs.  The agent releases
                         the resources and removes the associated
                         rows in the atmVclTable.

                      VC Cross-Connect Reconfiguration

                      At the discretion of the agent, a VC
                      cross-connect may be reconfigured by
                      adding and/or deleting leafs to/from
                      the VC topology as per the VC cross-connect
                      establishment/retirement procedures.
                      Reconfiguration of traffic/QoS parameter
                      values requires release of the VC cross-connect
                      before those parameter values may by changed
                      for individual VCLs."
