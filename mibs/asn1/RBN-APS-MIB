    DESCRIPTION
        "This management information module supports the configuration and 
         management of SONET linear APS groups.  The definitions and 
         descriptions used in this mib have been derived from 
         GR-253-CORE Revision 2, January 1999, section 5.3.

         The mib contains four tables. 

         The apsConfigTable supports addition, modification and deletion of
         entries representing linear APS groups.  Ring APS groups are not 
         currently supported by this MIB.  Entries are indexed by a text
         group name. Each entry contains parameters that specify the
         configuration of a particular linear APS group.

         The apsCommandTable provides linear APS commands that support
         protection switching and the ability to modify APS operation.
         Commands may only be entered if the corresponding 
         apsConfigRowStatus instance is set to active.

         The apsStatusTable provides statistics and information about
         the current APS group state.

         The apsChanTable provides the ability to add and delete
         SONET LTE channels from APS groups. Additionally
         statistics and current state information are provided
         at the APS channel level. The table contains entries for
         each SONET LTE interface available on the system. The
         field apsChanGroupName is initially set to a string of
         size zero indicating that the SONET LTE is not part of 
         an APS group. Fields that are associated with APS configuration 
         may be modified. An apsChanEntry instance may not be added or 
         deleted through rbnApsMIB mib access operations. However, an 
         apsChanEntry may be added or deleted through other 
         system mechanisms, such as hot swap. 

         An APS group is created and configured with the following sequence
         of events:

         CHANNEL CONFIGURATION

         Set the apsChanGroupName in an apsChanEntry to a 
         user-friendly text string. The string must not be equal to
         the apsConfigName of an existing apsConfigEntry with 
         apsConfigRowStatus set to active, since a channel cannot be
         added to an active group. The string may be set equal
         to the apsConfigName of a row which is currently not
         set to active, or it may be set to a string which does
         not currently exist in any instance of apsConfigName. 
         A channel number is entered in apsChanNumber.
         A channel priority is entered in apsChanPriority, if
         the intended architecture is 1:n. apsChanPriority is
         ignored if the architecture is 1+1.

         This step is repeated for all apsChanEntry instances
         which are to be included in the APS group.

         ACTIVATING THE GROUP

         If the apsChanGroupName does not exist in an instance
         of apsConfigName, an apsGroupEntry is created with
         the apsChanGroupName value used as the index for the row.
         The apsConfigRowStatus value may be set to createAndGo.
         The apsGroupConfigEntry and apsChanEntry instances with
         matching name fields will be checked for consistency.
         If any errors in the channel numbers, architecture or
         configuration are uncovered the apsConfigRowStatus set
         will return inconsistentValue , otherwise noError is returned.

         If the apsChanGroupName value used in channel configuration
         exists in a previously created, inactive apsChanEntry instance,
         the apsConfigRowStatus value may be set to active.

               oneToN
               
               The 1:n architecture allows one protection channel to
               protect up to n working channels. When a fault is detected
               on one of the n working channels that channel is bridged
               over the protection channel.

               When the condition that caused a switch to the protection
               line has been cleared the signal is switched back to the
               working line. If this bit is clear it indicates a 
               non-revertive system which remains on the protection line 
               until another switch request is received.
             
               bidirectional 
                       
               The bi-directional mode provides protection in both 
               directions.

               If this bit is clear it indicates  unidirectional mode which
               provides protection in one direction. The default for 1:n is 
               bidirectional. The default for 1+1 is unidirectional.

               Extra traffic may be carried on the protection channel in
               a 1:n architecture if this flag is set. It may be necessary
               to disable this in order to interwork with other SONET 
               network elements that don't support extra traffic.

    DESCRIPTION
        "A textual name for the APS group which this channel is
         included in.

        This object may not be modified if an instance of 
        apsConfigName exists with the same value and the associated
        apsConfigRowStatus object is equal to active.

        If the channel is not part of an APS group this value is set to
        a string of size 0. 

        This field can be changed from a string of size 0 to a value 
        of apsConfigName which has an associated apsConfigRowStatus 
        object which is not set to active. This action includes the
        SONET LTE into the inactive APS group.

        This field can be changed from a string of size 0 to a value 
        which is not equal to any existing instance of apsConfigName.
        This action is the initial step in adding a SONET LTE to a
        new APS group. An instance of apsConfigName equal to this
        instance of apsChanGroupName will subsequently be created.
 
        If this field is set to any non-empty string it may only
        be set to a string of size 0. If an attempt is made to set 
        this field from a non-empty string to another non-empty string 
        the error inconsistentValue will be returned. This prevents
        a manager from inadvertantly re-assigning a channel."

    DESCRIPTION
    "This field is set to a unique channel number within an APS group.
     The value 0 indicates the null channel. The values 1-14 define a
     working channel.
     
     If the port is not part of an APS group this value is set to 0.

     If an attempt is made to set this field when the associated 
     apsChanGroupName field is a string of size 0 the error
     inconsistentValue is returned. 

     If an attempt is made to set this field when an associated 
     apsConfigName field exists and the corresponding apsConfigRowStatus 
     field is set to active the error inconsistentValue is returned.

     This field must be assigned a unique number within the group.
     When an attempt is made to set the  corresponding apsConfigRowStatus 
     field to active the apsChanNumber values of all entries with equal 
     apsChanGroupName fields must represent a set of consecutive integer 
     values beginning with 0 and ending with n, where n is greater than or 
     equal to 1 and less than or equal to 14. Otherwise the error
     inconsistentValue is returned to the apsConfigRowStatus set attempt."
