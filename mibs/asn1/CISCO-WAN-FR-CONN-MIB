    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module to configure the Frame Relay
         connection configuration.
 
         Terminologies Used:

             SIW - Frame-Relay-to ATM Service Interworking.
                   In SIW, the ATM port connected to a frame
                   relay port does not need to be aware that
                   it is connected to an interworking function.

                   This is explained in document FRF.8.
     
             NIW - Frame-Relay-to ATM Network Interworking.
                   In NIW, the ATM port connected to a frame
                   relay port does need to be aware that
                   it is connected to an interworking function.

             PVC - Permanent Virtual Circuit OR
                   Permanent Virtual Connection

                   A frame relay logical link, whose endpoints
                   and class of service are defined by network
                   management. A PVC consists of the originating
                   frame relay network element address, originating
                   DLCI, terminating frame relay network element
                   address and terminating DLCI.

                   This is controlled by PAR(Portable Auto Route)
                   controller.


             SPVC - Soft Permanent Virtual Circuits.
                    This is a PVC controlled by PNNI Controller.

             Frame Relay PVC/SPVC end-point/Channel is referred to as 
             frame Relay connection in this MIB.

             Traffic shaping parameters:
                 CIR, EIR, Bc, Be, DE, Tc, AR corresponding to
                 rate of the physical interface.

             CIR - Committed Information Rate.

                   This is the rate of traffic that the PVC
                   will support as 'comitted' traffic.

                   The committed rate(in bits per second) at which
                   the ingress access interface trunk interfaces,
                   and egress access interface of a frame relay
                   network transfer information to the destination
                   frame relay end system under normal conditions.
                   The rate is averaged over a minimum time interval
                   Tc. 

             AR  - Access Rate
                   The maximum number of bits per second that an end
                   station can transmit into the network is
                   bounded by the acess rate of the user-network
                   interface. The line speed of the user network
                   connection limits the access rate.

             Bc  - Committed Burst Size
                   The maximum amount of data(in bits) that the
                   network agrees to transfer, under normal conditions
                   during a time interval Tc.
                   The data is in bytes in the current implementation.

             Be  - Excess Burst Size
                   The maximum amount of uncommitted data(in bits)
                   in excess of BC that a frame relay network can
                   attempt to deliver during a time interval Tc.
                   This data generally is delivered with a low
                   probability than Bc. The network treats Be
                   data as discard eligible.
                   The data is in bytes in the current implementation.

             Tc  - The committed rate measurement interval.
                   The time interval during which the user can send
                   only BC committed amount of data and BE excess
                   amount of data.

             EIR - Excess Information Rate
                   This is the bandwidth in excess of CIR
                   the PVC will be allowed to burst on a 
                   a given PVC.

                   The average rate at which excess traffic is
                   to be policed. This number is computed based
                   on Bc, Be, CIR and Tc.

             DE  - Discard Eligibility


             Frame Forwarding Port: Frame Forwarding Ports are identified
             by portType = frame-forward(3). 

             NOTE: The objects related to frame relay ports are
                   available in ifTable,if ifTable is implemented
                   in service module/card.

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object is added only for FRSM12 card.

        This counter tracks the number of configuration changes
	that happen on a channel. The  counter is
	associated only with the end point  and NOT with the
	connection itself.

	This counter is used by the NMS to determine if a connection
	configuration had been modified and requires an upload.
	This functionality is conventionally achieved by time 
	stamping using a time-of-day clock. However, in switches
	where time-of-day clock is not available, the following
	scheme is used:

	The upload counter is incremented, when:

	* assignment of connection to an end point channel. This
	  happens when a connection is added and assigned this 
	  channel number.
	* de-assignment of connection from a channel number. This
	  happens when a connection is deleted and the 
	  end point  resource is released.
	* When there is a configuration change done to the connection
	  that is associated with this end point channel number.
        
        In a new system, an unutilised resouce (channel number)
        has a counter value of zero. When a connection is added to
	this channel end point, the counter is incremented. And is
	incremented for any of the above operations. When a connection
	is deleted the value of this counter is incremented and
	preserved till a new connection gets associated with this
	channel end point.
