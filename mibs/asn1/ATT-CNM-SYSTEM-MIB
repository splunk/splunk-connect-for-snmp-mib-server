	attCNMsysDescr OBJECT-TYPE
		SYNTAX  DisplayString(SIZE(0..255))
		ACCESS  read-only
		STATUS  mandatory
		DESCRIPTION
			"A printable ASCII string that is a textual
			description of this system. This value typically
			includes the full name and version identification
			of the system.

			This identification can be used to distinguish
			this system from other systems for the purpose of
			fault identification/isolation, trouble reporting etc."
		::= { att-cnm-system 1 }

	attCNMsysObjectID OBJECT-TYPE
		SYNTAX  OBJECT IDENTIFIER
		ACCESS  read-only
		STATUS  mandatory
		DESCRIPTION
			"The vendor's authoritative identification of the
			network management subsystem contained in the entity.

			This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises
			subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and
			unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box'
			is being managed.  For example, if vendor `Flintstones,
			Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, it
			could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.1 to
			its `Fred Router'.

			This identification can be used to distinguish this
			system from other systems."
		::= { att-cnm-system 2 }

	attCNMsysUpTime OBJECT-TYPE
		SYNTAX  TimeTicks
		ACCESS  read-only
		STATUS  mandatory
		DESCRIPTION
			"The time (in hundredths of a second) since the
			SNMP interface portion of the system was last
			re-initialized.

			This value may be used to determine the last time
			this system was re-initialized (i.e. the most
			recent reset for the SNMP interface)."
		::= { att-cnm-system 3 }

	attCNMsysContact OBJECT-TYPE
		SYNTAX  DisplayString(SIZE(0..255))
		ACCESS  read-only
		STATUS  mandatory
		DESCRIPTION
			"The textual identification of the contact person(s)
			or organization(s) for this system, along with
			information on how to contact them."
		::= { att-cnm-system 4 }

	attCNMsysName OBJECT-TYPE
		SYNTAX  DisplayString(SIZE(0..255))
		ACCESS  read-only
		STATUS  mandatory
		DESCRIPTION
			"An administratively-assigned name for this
			system. By convention, this is the system's
			fully-qualified domain name.

			This variable distinguishes this system from other
			systems in the network."
		::= { att-cnm-system 5 }

	attCNMsysLocation OBJECT-TYPE
		SYNTAX  DisplayString(SIZE(0..255))
		ACCESS  read-only
		STATUS  mandatory
		DESCRIPTION
			"The physical location of this system.

			This variable distinguishes this system from others
			for location purposes."
		::= { att-cnm-system 6 }

	attCNMsysServices OBJECT-TYPE
		SYNTAX  INTEGER(0..127)
		ACCESS  read-only
		STATUS  mandatory
		DESCRIPTION
			"A value which indicates the set of services offered
			by the managed network elements.

			The value is a sum.  This sum initially takes the
			value zero, Then, for each layer, L, in the range
			1 through 7, that this node performs transactions
			for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum.  For
			example, a node which performs primarily routing
			functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)).  In
			contrast, a node which is a host offering
			application services would have a value of 72
			(2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)).  Note that in the context of
			the Internet suite of protocols, values should be
			calculated accordingly:

				layer  functionality
				 1	physical (e.g., repeaters)
				 2	datalink/subnetwork (e.g., bridges)
				 3	internet (e.g., IP gateways)
				 4	end-to-end  (e.g., IP hosts)
				 7	applications (e.g., mail relays)

			For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and
			6 may also be counted.

			For SMDS and Frame Relay Service, this agent will
			return a value of 2 which indicates that the managed
			network elements offer a subnetwork-level service."
