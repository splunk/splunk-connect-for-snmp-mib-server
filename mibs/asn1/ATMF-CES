    DESCRIPTION 
        "Indicates the port associated with a Circuit Emulation
         connection.  Objects of this type are always defined as
         part of a set that includes
            fooPort       CESConnectionPort
            fooVpi        VpiInteger
            fooVci        VciInteger
         The interpretation of these objects is as follows:
         1. If no connection exists, 'fooPort' has a value of 0.
            Because Interface table entries always have 'ifIndex'
            values greater than 0, 'fooPort' reliably serves as a
            'connection exists' flag.
            If no connection exists, 'fooVpi' and 'fooVci' are 
            not relevant and have a value of 0.
         2. If a PVC or SVC exists, 'fooPort' is defined to have
            the value of the MIB-II/RFC1573 'ifIndex' of the ATM
            interface associated with the VCC.  The ifType
            associated with such an ifIndex value is either
            atm(37) or atmLogical(80). 'fooVpi' and 'fooVci'
            will contain its VPI/VCI."
