    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module defines ingest manager configuration objects
        that faciliate the management of the Cisco Content Delivery
        System for TV (CDS-TV) product family.

        CDS-TV is a suite of products and software applications
        providing ingest, storage, caching, streaming, playout and
        on-demand delivery of video to television or set-top-box
        clients.

        Abbreviations:

        CCP     Cache Control Protocol
        CDS     Content Delivery System
        CORBA   Common Object Request Broker Architecture 
        ISA     Interactive Services Architecture
        ISV     Integrated Streamer-Vault
        FSI     File Service Interface
        FTP     File Transfer Protocol
        MPEG    Motion Picture Experts Group
        MSA     Managed Services Architecture
        RTSP    Real-Time Streaming Protocol
        STB     Set-Top Box

        Common terms:

        Catcher: Device responsible for receiving content (typically via
        satellite dishes and antennae) from content providers or from a
        Headend-In-The-Sky. 

        Content Ingest: Acquisition of content from a source such as a
        catcher or an FTP server for storing it locally and making it
        available to streamers as needed.

        Ingest Manager: CDS module that takes care of provisioned
        content objects by collecting metadata, sending messages to the
        appropriate subsystem to ingest the content, and sending
        messages to expire the content when the expiration period has
        passed. 

        Device Roles:

        Vault: Content delivery application responsible for ingesting
        and storing video content and making it available to streamers
        and/or caching nodes.

        Caching Nodes: Content delivery application responsible for
        caching content from vault (using CCP) and then streaming
        content out to streamers over HTTP or CCP.

        Streamer: Content delivery application responsible for streaming
        video out to STB's.

        ISV: Content delivery application capable of acting as both a
        vault and as a streamer in a single device."
