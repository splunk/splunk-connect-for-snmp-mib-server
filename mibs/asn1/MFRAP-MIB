--
--  The MFRAP MIB Tree
--      This MIB covers the Sync Research MFRAP, a T1 CSU for dedicated
--      or switched (T1) applications.  This product is managed via an
--      integral agent.
--
--  The MFRAP MIB Consists of five groups (plus Traps):
--      The SYSTEM group
--      The CONFIGURATION group
--      The DIAGNOSTICS group
--      The STATUS group
--      The PERFORMANCE group
--
--  The SYSTEM group
--      This group provides system level attributes of the node.
--

--
--       The Connection Configuration Table
--         The Connection Configuration table contains methods for
--         assigning T1 network bandwidth to ports. In auto entry mode
--         the user provides a starting DS0 and the node assigns
--         sequential, contiguous, DS0s; all of the same type.
--         In manual entry the user configures each DS0 
--         separately. In manual mode the DS0s may be assigned 
--         discontinuously and could be a mix of voice, 
--         transparent or frame relay circuits. 
--
--         DTE connection configuration uses the auto entry mode.
--         The objects controlling this configuration can be found
--         in the DTE Configuration Table (mfrapCfgDteTable).  When 
--         a valid set of DTE connection parameters exist (the current 
--         values are used for parameters not set), the 
--         mfrapCfgEditConnTable must FIRST be updated using the 
--         mfrapCfgDteConnAutoUpdate object.  Thus to effect a change
--         in DTE connections, sets of BOTH mfrapCfgDteConnAutoUpdate
--         AND mfrapCfgConnUpdateCmd must be done. 
--
--         Drop & Insert connection configuration uses the manual
--         entry mode by directly writing to the mfrapCfgEditConnTable 
--         below.  If a legal set value leads to an invalid configuration,
--         the mfrapCfgConnStatus object will return an incorrect-bandwidth 
--         or bandwidth-conflict indication. 
--
--         In order to delete a connection, the mfrapCfgEditMode object
--         is set to not-connected.  The states of the other 
--         mfrapCfgEditTable objects will be updated automatically.
--
--         When the mfrapCfgConnUpdateCmd is set and the configuration is
--         valid, the connections will be updated and reads of the 
--         mfrapCfgCurrentConnTable will reflect the updated connections.

             for an extended time and is reporting an alarm condition 
             that severely impairs normal operation. During this Red

             to the WAN. If this condition persists consult your 
             service provider.
         (3) Yellow ALarm Detected - Unit is receiving a yellow alarm 
             indication from the wide area network. Detection of yellow 
             alarm implies that the attached device is in a red alarm 
             conditon. Red alarm is declared due to the extended absence 
             of a properly framed signal. If this condition persists 
             consult your service provider.
         (4) Unframe All Ones Detected - Unit is receiving unframed all 
             ones from the wide area network (AIS, blue alarm). Detection 
             of AIS implies that the attached device is reporting
             an alarm condition from an upstream device. If

        "VNIP topology is a feature that, for each interface, maps all 
         compatible VNIP peers, their DLCI value, ip address and relative 
         location. The topology is a fundamental prerequisite to applying 
         the VNIP feature set which includes PVC-based delay measurement, 
         diagnostics, and congestion monitoring. With VNIP enabled on an 
         interface the unit will attempt to locate VNIP peers out that port.
         As peers are discovered and logged the unit will report the topology
         it has learned on its opposite interface. If VNIP is inactive on 
         one interface it will not engage in any VNIP dialog; however it 
         will continue to listen for topology messages on the inactive 
         interface and will reflect these messages out the opposite interface
         if VNIP is enabled. With VNIP inactive on both interfaces the unit 
         will transparently pass all VNIP messages. The topology database 
         includes the interface, local DLCI value, remote peer DLCI value, 
         remote peer ip address, and the number of VNIP hops in between.
         This table also reports the status of other VNIP features as well."
