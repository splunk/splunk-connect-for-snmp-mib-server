     DESCRIPTION
     "              
     This module defines the cig Clients. The first client in the DHCP client used for getting 
     dynamic IP address and configuration parameters from DHCP server.The DHCP client will be 
     a function of interfaces.
     The second client is DNS resolver client.

-- Version 200910251352Z
-- 1. Updating IPv6 notes.
                                            
-- Version 200909011828Z
-- 1. Add IPv6 mib definitions.
                       
-- Version 200531050827Z
-- 1. Add cigDhcpClientsDefaultRouterTrackId for tracking the default router.

-- Version 200509021627Z
-- cigDhcpClientsClientId and cigDhcpClientsHostName will be limited to 80 characters
--
-- Version 200407110820Z
-- Updating DNS Client MIB
-- 1. Adding new MIB item cigDnsResolverOperations with the enumeration clearDynamicServers(2) that
-- will clear all the dynamic servers (learnt from PPP interfaces and DHCP clients) 
-- from DNS server list.
-- 
-- Version 200421101022Z
-- Updating DHCP client MIB
-- 1. Updating the cigDhcpClientsStatus enumeration. Adding idle(9) and reboot(8) states        
-- and changing the enumeration of release(6) and decline(7).
-- 2. Updating the description of cigDhcpClientsHostName.
-- 3. Change the name of cigDhcpClientsRequestList to cigDhcpClientsRequestBitmap and update the 
-- description.   
-- 4. Change the cigDhcpClientsDefaultGateway to cigDhcpClientsDefaultGatewayList and 
-- cigDhcpClientsDnsServer to cigDhcpClientsDnsServerList.

-- 1. Adding cigDnsResolverDnsServerListIndex as index to cigDnsResolverDnsServerEntry.
-- 2. Adding note to cigDnsResolverDnsServerRowStatus.
-- 3. cigDnsResolverDnsServerType is R/O instead of R/W. The type is determined according the index 
--    of the server (1-6 static - user configuration and 100-... dynamic servers - automatic/device
--    configuration).
-- 4. Changing cigDnsResolverDomain to be DisplayString [1..255] instead of [1..256].
