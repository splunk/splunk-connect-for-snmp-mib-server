    DESCRIPTION
        "The Cisco Unified Multi-Modal Contact Applications (MMCA) platform is
        a highly scalable, modular, extensible, open and secure platform for 
        providing contact center applications. The Cisco Unified Expert Advisor
        (CUEA) is implemented on this platform.
              The Cisco Unified Expert Advisor application is deployed on 
        multiple devices that form a cluster, where each device could be 
        classified as 'Runtime' or 'Reporting'. Each device hosts a set of  
        services and each service performs a specific task. Not all services 
        will be running on every device. 
              The CISCO-MMODAL-CONTACT-APPS-MIB  defines the instrumentation of 
        the services present in the Cisco Unified Expert Advisor. The MIB 
        mainly consists of the run-time statistics of each service and also 
        defines a Notification format. It also defines various groups of 
        objects that are not specific to a service.

        DEFINITION OF TERMS AND ACRONYMS

        ACD        Automatic Call Distributor
        ACMI       Advanced Contact Management Interface.  The interface
                   used by the ICM to talk to generic peripherals. Also
                   known as GED-188
        Agent      An Agent, also known as Expert Advisor, is a person in the 
                   enterprise who is capable of handling calls from CUEA
        AQ         Assignment Queue
        Assignment 
        Queue      Assignment Queues allow Cisco Unified ICM to route call 
                   requests to groups of expert advisors. Various experts may 
                   qualify for various assignment queues based on the 
                   assignment queue membership rules, and they then log in 
                   or out of, as well as change their availability with respect 
                   to those assignment queues. An expert advisor who is 
                   available on a given assignment queue is able 
                   to be considered by the Work Assigner to receive calls 
                   according to the assignment queue's selection strategy.
        Attribute
        Definition Attributes Definitions are used by assignment queues and 
                   expert advisors. Attributes are defined by CUEA 
                   administrators and assigned to assignment queues and 
                   expert advisors. Expert advisors are routed call 
                   requests if the expert advisor's skills and attributes 
                   match those of the Assignment Queue.

        Contact    A Contact is the internal object that represents an internal
                   call.  The Contact is created when the call arrives at 
                   CUEA, and does not terminate until the caller disconnects

CmmcaServiceType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention is used to identify the type of service.
        The Cisco Unified Expert Advisor includes one or but probably 
        multiple, of the following services. 

        'cm':       Contact Manager:  The Contact manager    
                    service is responsible for the handling of call
                    requests and maintaining contact state. CM uses     
                    BRE to help direct call flow decision making.  
                    The major services that the CM interfaces with are
                    the Work Assigner (WA), Media Platform Interface 
                    (MPA), Knowledge Broker (KB), the ICM Gateway (GW),
                    and Business Rules Execution Engine (BRE).
        'rm':       Resource Manager: The Resource Manager (RM) is 
                    responsible for maintaining the state of assignable
                    resources, e.g. agents. The RM interfaces to the 
                    Work Assigner, Media Platform Interface, Resource 
                    Desktop Adapter and Business Rules Engine.
        'wa':       Work assigner: The Work Asssigner is responsible 
                    for matching Contacts that need Resources with 
                    Resources that need Contacts. 
        'mpa':      Media Platform Adapter: The Media Platform 
                    Adapter is a generic interface to various switching
                    and call control platforms. Removes inconsistencies
                    and normalizes messages before sending them. It is
                    an SIP Back to Back user Agent, providing basic third
                    party call control and end point functions to its
                    clients(RM,CM,RDA).
        'bre':      Business Rules Engine: The BRE allows        
                    customers to define how the system will behave and 
                    then execute scripts or business rules at runtime.      
        'icmgw':    ICM Gateway : The ICM Gateway talks to the 
                    ERS PG of ICM over the GED-188 (ACMI) protocol. It 
                    sends agent state information to the ICM so that 
                    the ICM knows whether or not to route calls.
        'rda':      Resource Desktop Adapter: This service is used by  
                    RM to communicate to the user interface of the 
                    Resource(Agent). It provides a normalized interface
                    (RDI) to the RM that removes differences between 
                    communicating to different types of desktops or 
                    Resources viz;CTI-OS, Presence, WebBased desktops or
                    Traditional/occasional agents.
        'ra':       Reporting Adapter: RAs listen to event streams 
                    that are produced by runtime components. They then 
                    take those events, convert them as appropriate (for
                    example, converting them to a particular version of
                    a schema or applying a security policy of what data
                    can be sent to the reporting database) and then 
                    send a new message to the Cisco MMCA Reporting 
                    Subsystem.
        'rs':       Reporting Subsystem: The RS is responsible for 
                    writing data into the reporting database. It 
                    receives messages from various Reporting Adapters 
                    and converts them into db writes."

CmmcaServiceStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention is used to identify the run status of a Cisco
        Unified Expert Advisor service. The value shown is the result of 
        evaluating the current run status of each of the individual elements 
        associated with the service.

        'disabled'          The service has not yet begun to start
                            up.

        'starting'          The service is in initialization
                            procedure, configuring and licensing, not
                            accepting connections yet.

        'inService'         The service is up and running optimally,
                            accepting connections at full QoS (if
                            applicable).

        'inServiceWarning'  The service is running sub-optimally,
                            possibly due to poor QoS or a threshold
                            reached; see transition reason for
                            explanation.

        'inServiceCritical' The service is running but very near to
                            failure, similar to 'inServiceWarning'
                            but much more dire.

        'partialService'    The service is no longer accepting new
                            calls but finishes processing active calls
                            (may be due to a loss of a dependency/
                            connectivity, or a shutdown request).

        'outOfService'      The service is no longer accepting new calls  
                            and is down for some reason. It can still be
                            brought in service.

        'stopping'          The service no longer accepts new
                            connections, lets current connections
                            terminate gracefully.

        'stopped'           The service has shut down and is not
                            processing any more calls.  The process
                            itself is terminating (doing memory
                            cleanup, saving settings, shutting down
                            threads, etc.).

        'unknown'           The status of the mmca service is unknown
                            to the SNMP agent either because the link
                            between the agent and the application has

                            of refreshing service status.  (A refresh
                            typically occurs after an agent restart

                            system or service is unusable.  Immediate
                            operator intervention is required.  

        'alert':            This severity level event indicates that a
                            devastating failure is imminent that will
                            render the system unusable.  Immediate
                            operator attention is necessary.

                            occur soon; an error has occurred that
                            was not appropriately handled by the

                            soon as possible.

                            has experienced a temporary impairment or an error 
                            that was appropriately handled by the system.                            

        'warning':          This severity level event may be a precursor to an 
                            error occurrence.  An operator should review the 
                            event soon to determine if action is needed.

                            administrator at this time.

        'informational':    This severity level event contains interesting
                            system-level information that is valuable
                            to an administrator, however, the event

        "This table describes CM instances configured on this Device. The
        Contact Manager (CM) service is responsible for the handling of
        call requests and maintaining contact state. Instances may load
        share as well as support different types of contacts. This
        service is a critical funnel point to the rest of the system. CM
        uses BRE to help direct call flow decision making. The CM must
        be able to transparently scale and provide for fault tolerance.
        This is best modeled as the CM receiving work from a virtual
        queue. 
            The CM only participates within a single routing domain, and
        therefore only talks to a single Work Assigner.  Each CM is also
        tied to a single MPA.  The BRE used by the CM can be shared
        among components (both CMs and RMs).

        configured on this Device. The Work Assigner is responsible for 
        matching Contacts that need Resources with Resources that 
        need Contacts.
                          The scope of a single work assigner defines a
        Routing Domain.  A Routing Domain is a set of Contacts and a set
        of Resources that can be assigned to each other.  This means
        that the size of a routing domain is constrained by how scalable
        a Work Assigner can be.  Because of this, the Work Assigner
        tries to be as streamlined as possible and delegate all logic
        that deals with the scope of an individual resource or
        individual contact to the RM or the CM.
           Work Assigner is not the only interface that is used to
        communicate between the RM and the CM, it merely provides the
        initial assignment between the two , much in the same manner as
        a SIP connects two endpoints, and then gets out of the call.
          The Work Assigner also includes the logic to execute advanced
        routing features (such as resume routing, spatial routing,
        etc).

        "This table describes Reporting Adapter (RA) services configured
        on this Device. Reporting adapters listen to event stream that are
        produced by runtime components.  They then take those events,
        convert them as appropriate (for example, converting them to a
        particular version of a schema or applying a security policy of
        what data can be sent to the reporting database) and then send a
        new message to the Reporting Subsystem service.  This
        message is sent using durability and persistence to ensure that
        the message will get to the Reporting Subsystem (RS).

                Reporting Adapters run on the same Device as the runtime
        components that they are monitoring.  This is because the events
        that are being produced are delivered on a best-effort basis,
        and being on the same Device (and in the same JVM) ensures that
        the adapter will receive the event.

        "This table describes ICM Gateway(ICMGW) services configured on
        this Device. The ICM Gateway talks to the ERS PG of ICM over
        the GED-188 (ACMI) protocol. It sends agent state information to
        the ICM so that the ICM knows whether or not to route calls to
        Cisco Unified Expert Advisor and if so to which skill groups, i.e. 
        assignment queues. Another critical function is to allow translation
        routing of calls from ICM and getting call context information
        from those calls into CUEA.
               Unlike a conventional ACD, the ICM Gateway doesnt track
        individual calls and generate every call event to the PIM.
        Instead, it relays agent status events to the ERS PG, and the
        PG is then able to fabricate real-time agent/skill-group
        reports and sends to the ICM Central Controller. The ICM Gateway also
        forwards call termination details to the PG and based on those
        the modified OPC at the PG can create half-hour reports.
               This table has a sparse dependent relationship with
        cmmcaServiceTable and hence uses its index."
