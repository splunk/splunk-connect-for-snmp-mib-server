         When the disconnected timer elapses, or when a command is received
         from the call agent or when there is a local user activity, the 
         Media Gateway sends the Restart In Progress command with the restart 
         method as RM:disconnected to the Media Gateway Controller.

         If the disconnected procedure still left the endpoint disconnected,
         the disconnected timer is doubled subject to a provisionable
         disconnected maximum waiting delay (Tdmax) in seconds and the
         gateway starts the new disconnected procedure again.

         Once the maximum value is reached, the subsequent disconnected
         Restart In Progress commands use the maximum waiting delay (Tdmax).
         
         The recommended value of this object is 600 seconds.
