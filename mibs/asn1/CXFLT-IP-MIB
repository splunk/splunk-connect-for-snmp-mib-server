        DESCRIPTION 
"The Ip Frame Filtering and Forwarding (FF) Address Table 
(shortcut: fltiptbl) allows you to enable/disable routing and to select 
forwarding priorities for specific IP addresses.  The table has a maximum
of 32 entries.  Table entries take effect only after a warm start
(sysmgt restart=1).

A packet's addressing information is analyzed and compared with the entry 
in the FF table and the routing module filters it or forwards it with the
specified priority.  If there is no FF information for the given address,
it will be forwarded with normal priority.

Using the FF functionality, you can restrict the amount of IP traffic being 
routed or you can prioritize the traffic according to urgency."
