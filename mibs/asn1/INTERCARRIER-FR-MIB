Abstract

   This memo defines a private extension to the Management Information
   Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based
   internets.  In particular, it defines objects that Local Exchange
   Carriers (LECs) and Interexchange Carriers (ICs) can use to manage
   intercarrier Frame Relay (i.e., when multiple carriers are involved
   in providing Frame Relay Service to end-users).

   This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.

1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

      o    RFC 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
           describing and naming objects for the purpose of
           management.

      o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
           objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

      o    RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative and other
           architectural aspects of the framework.

      o    RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network
           access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named
   by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor,
   to refer to the object type.

3.  Overview

   This section provides an overview and background of how to use this MIB
   module and other potential MIB modules when managing a Frame Relay
   Intercarrier Interface (ICI).  A Frame Relay ICI interconnects two
   Frame Relay carriers involved in providing an end-to-end Frame
   Relay Service [5].

   An Exchange Access Operations Management (XA-OM) service is a set of
   network management capabilities provided by a Local Exchange Carrier
   (LEC) to an Interexchange Carrier (IC).  These capabilities are
   intended to enable an IC to directly manage aspects of its exchange
   access service.  Exchange access service is provided by a LEC to an
   IC in support of the IC's inter-Local Access and Transport Area (LATA)
   service offering.

   The following diagram shows the MIB stack that could be followed for
   managing intercarrier Frame Relay.  This is only an example and not
   meant to be inclusive.

         +----------------------------------------------------------+
         +  MIB  |  Intercarrier FR    |  FR Service MIB    |   T   +
         +   II  |---------------------|--------------------|   C   +
         +       |                 DS1 & DS3                |   A   +
         +----------------------------------------------------------+

3.1.  Scope of MIB Module

   The intercarrier Frame Relay MIB module will only manage the Frame
   Relay portion of the network related to the Frame Relay ICI. Frame
   Relay XA-OM also relies on the Frame Relay Service MIB module [6],
   the DS3 MIB module [7], the DS1 MIB module[8], and TCA MIB module [9].

   This MIB will NOT be implemented on User Equipment (e.g., DTE).
   The Frame Relay DTE MIB (RFC 1315) should be used to manage those
   devices [10].

   The Frame Relay SNMP MIB module for XA-OM is an SNMPv2 MIB.  It
   provides read-only information that allows an IC to obtain performance
   monitoring information about the ICIs that interconnect its network
   with a LEC's network to provide intercarrier Frame Relay.  By using
   this and other related MIB modules, a carrier's (i.e., IC's) NM
   application can monitor ICIs and service aspects of intercarrier
   Frame Relay.  Internal aspects of the network (e.g., switching
   elements, and line cards) are outside the scope of this MIB module.
   The carrier's NM application will be able to access the SNMP proxy
   agent within a LEC's Frame Relay network using SNMP over UDP over
   IP with IP encapsulated in Frame Relay according to RFC1490/ANSI
   T1.617 Annex F [11,12].

Bellcore                Intercarrier Frame Relay MIB          September 1994


   The initial implementation of the MIB module is based on SNMPv2.  The
   service capabilities include retrieving information.  This MIB module
   does NOT include managed objects that: 

       1) Monitor the physical layer,

       2) Support Threshold Crossing Alerts specified for Frame
          Relay XA-OM, and

       3) Provide information pertaining to the overall management
          of the Frame Relay Service.  

   These objects have already been defined in the DS1, DS3, TCA, and
   Frame Relay Service MIB modules referred to earlier.
