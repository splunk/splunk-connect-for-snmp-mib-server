    DESCRIPTION
            "This MIB module defines the IANAtunnelType textual
            convention for use in MIBs which need to identify
            types of IP tunnels.

            To assign new tunnel type values, IANA should apply
            the same requirements as it applies to IANAifType
            values.  Requests for IANAifType values to be assigned
            for new IP tunnel types should instead result in
            assignments of new tunnel type values."

    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
            "The encapsulation method used by a tunnel. The value
            direct indicates that a packet is encapsulated
            directly within a normal IP header, with no
            intermediate header, and unicast to the remote tunnel
            endpoint (e.g., an RFC 2003 IP-in-IP tunnel, or an RFC
            1933 IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel). The value minimal indicates
            that a Minimal Forwarding Header (RFC 2004) is
            inserted between the outer header and the payload
            packet. The value UDP indicates that the payload
            packet is encapsulated within a normal UDP packet
            (e.g., RFC 1234).

            The values sixToFour, sixOverFour, and isatap
            indicates that an IPv6 packet is encapsulated directly
            within an IPv4 header, with no intermediate header,
            and unicast to the destination determined by the 6to4,
            6over4, or ISATAP protocol.

            The remaining protocol-specific values indicate that a
            header of the protocol of that name is inserted
            between the outer header and the payload header."
