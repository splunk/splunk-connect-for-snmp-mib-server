            generation ID of the neighbor.  For example, it should be
            generated at the time a neighbor is first heard from if the
            prune bit is not set in its capabilities.  It should also be
            generated if the local system has the ability to tell that a
            neighbor which sets the the prune bit in its capabilities is
            not pruning any branches over an extended period of time.
            The trap should be generated only if the router has no other
            neighbors on the same interface with a lower IP address than
            itself."
