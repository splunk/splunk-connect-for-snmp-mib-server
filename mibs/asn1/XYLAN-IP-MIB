                 a Frame Relay service or a PPP service.  This will
                 be used to determine whether the slot/port/vc or
                 PeerId fields are applicable to this entry.  A value
                 of 1 implies that this field is not used. (The
                 interface is not a WAN interface or the filter is
                 not being applied to a specific VC or PeerId.) A
                 value of 2 indicates that this is a Frame Relay service
                 in which case the slot/port/vc fields can be used to
                 apply the filter to a specific VC.  A value of 3
                 indicates that this is a PPP service and the Peer ID
                 field may be used."
