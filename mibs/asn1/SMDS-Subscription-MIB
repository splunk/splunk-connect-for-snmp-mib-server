          1.  Status of this Memo

          This document is a private extension to the SNMP MIB.
          Distribution of this memo is unlimited.  Please send comments
          to the editor.


          2.  Abstract

          This memo defines a private portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
          protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it
          defines objects for managing SMDS subscription parameters.

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.

          3.  The Network Management Framework

          The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
          components.  They are:

                RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing
                and naming objects for the purpose of management.  RFC 1212
                defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly
                consistent with the SMI.

                RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for
                the Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213, defines MIB-II, an
                evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and new
                operational requirements.

                RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network
                access to managed objects.

             The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
             experimentation and evaluation.

          4.  Objects

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) [7] defined in the SMI.  In particular, each
          object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an
          object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which
          specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
          object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
          instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
          use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also
          refer to the object type.

          The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
          language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI RFC 1155
          [3] purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be
          used.  These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.

          The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type
          is represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly
          tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is
          how the object type is represented when being transmitted on
          the network.  The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding
          rules of ASN.1 [8], subject to the additional requirements
          imposed by the SNMP.

          4.1.  Format of Definitions

          Section 6 contains contains the specification of all object
          types contained in this MIB module.  The object types are
          defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended
          by the extensions specified in RFC 1212 and RFC 1215 [9,10].

          5.  Overview

          These objects are used in the context of a SNMP-based network
          management service that can be provided by networks supporting
          SMDS. This service is called SMDS Customer Network Management
          (CNM) Service and is defined in TA-TSV-001062 [11]. The
          service comprises access via a virtual SMDS information store
          to managed objects for the purpose of management operations by
          SMDS customers. The managed objects are maintained by the
          network supporting SMDS. Access is subject to appropriate
          authorization as defined in TA-TSV-001062 [11]. The SMDS
          information store consists of several MIB modules:

                    MIB II [6]   for general management of TCP/IP-based
                                 Internets (System and Interface Groups only),
                    SIP MIB [14] for the management of the SMDS Interface
                                 Protocol (SIP) RFC 1304,
                    DS1 MIB [15] for the management of DS1 based transmission
                                 media RFC 1232 (as amended by RFC 1239 [17]),
                                 This MIB is undergoing revision.  SMDS CNM
                                 will support the new MIB.
                    DS3 MIB [16] for the management of DS3 based transmission
                                 media RFC 1233 (as amended by RFC 1239 [17]),
                                 This MIB is undergoing revision.  SMDS CNM
                                 will support the new MIB.
                    Subscription MIB (this document) for the management of SMDS
                                 subscription parameters.

          The SMDS Customer Network Management Service is defined in
          Bellcore requirements documents TA-TSV-001062 [11].  See
          reference [11] to see how these MIB modules are used.  SMDS
          and its access protocol are defined in other Bellcore
          Requirements; TR-TSV-000772, TR-TSV-000773, and TR-TSV-001060
          [12, 13, 18].

          The other MIB modules that are part of the SNMP-based SMDS
          Customer Network Management Service as defined in TA-TSV-
          001062 [11] are posted as RFCs.

          Version 2.1 differs from Version 2.0 as follows:
          - Indexing using the SMDSAddress has been modified.
          - XA-SMDS Information has been updated.

          Version 2.0 differs from Version 1.0 as follows:
          - Several references have been updated.
          - The address screening tables have been changed to accommodate
             cases where multiple screening lists per SNI are used which
             reflects the requirements in TR-TSV-000772 [12].
          - The mcdusOut object has been changed to reflect the requirements
             in TR-TSV-000772 [12].
          - Some object names have been modified.
          - New tables and traps were added to support interLATA SMDS.

               -- The Address Screening Group is a collection of six tables.  These six tables
               -- are used to identify up to 4 Individual Address Screens and up to 4 Group

               -- be created and deleted by using these tables.  The default screens may be

               -- The Member Group Address Group identifies
               -- the individual address and all of the group addresses with which it is associated.
               -- Using this table, the group addresses can only be disassociated from the individual
               -- addresses; meaning that the group member may only delete the row and not create a new row

                      is divided into three fields.  These three fields
                      are used as indices into tables that need to be
                      indexed by an SMDS address.  These three fields
                      provide for a user-friendly/readable format in
                      order to do SETs and GETs.  The three fields are
                      country code, destination code, and subscriber
                      number.  Each field MUST only contain 1 to 9
                      digits and must NOT start with a zero.  All SMDS
                      addresses will have a country code.  Most SMDS
                      addresses will have a destination code (e.g., in
                      the US this number is the area code).  The
                      subscriber number is the rest of the SMDS address,
                      which is less than or equal to the remaining 9
                      digits.  For those SMDS addresses that do not have
                      a destination code or whose subscriber number is
                      more than 9 digits long, the destination code and
                      the subscriber number must be divided in a logical
                      way. Also, if a field starts with zero(s), then
                      these zero(s) must be the trailing zero(s) of the
                      previous field.  It is up to the service provider
                      to determine this logic.  This object describes
                      the way that the SMDS addresses are divided for
                      this SNI (ifIndex).  For example, in the US, this
                      object will contain the following text:  'Country
                      code = 1. Destination code = area code (e.g.,
                      908). Subscriber number = the remaining 7 digits
                      (e.g., 7582107). The OID looks like

                      higher value of s may be supported.  The screens
                      are distinguished by their screenType (i.e.,
                      individual or group) and by the screenIndex (i.e.,
                      a value between 1 and s).

                      This list identifies the s screens associated with
                      an SNI accompanied by an indication (screenStatus)
                      of whether the screening comprises 'allowed
                      addresses' or 'disallowed addresses' (i.e.,
                      whether the screen is applied as an inclusionary
                      or exclusionary restriction), or whether the
                      screen is not used (i.e., screening is turned off
                      and all SIP L3_PDUs are allowed; this is
                      identified by an empty list) or multiple
                      individual and group address screens are not
                      supported by the network supporting SMDS.

                      Different addresses on an SNI may be associated

                      SNI (i.e., both individual and group addresses)
                      that are associated with a particular Individual
                      Address Screen (associatedScreenIndIndex).  The
                      associatedAddressesGrpScreenTable includes all the
                      addresses (associatedAddressGrp) assigned to an
                      SNI (i.e., only individual addresses) that are
                      associated with a particular Group Address Screen
                      (associatedScreenGrpIndex).

                      For every SNI, there are: 1) defIAScreenForIAs;
                      the default Individual Address Screen used for
                      destination address screening at the network
                      ingress and source address screening at the
                      network egress of individually addressed L3_PDUs
                      when the associated SNI address is an Individual
                      Address.  2) defGAScreenForIAs; the default Group
                      Address Screen used for destination address
                      screening at the network ingress of group
                      addressed L3_PDUs.  The associated SNI address
                      will always be an Individual Address (i.e., it is
                      the Source Address).  3) defIAScreenForGAs; the
                      default Individual Address Screen used for source
                      address screening at the network egress of
                      individually addressed L3_PDUs when the associated
                      SNI address is a Group Address (i.e., it is the
                      Destination Address).

                      The individual address screen (all the
                      iAScreeningAddresses for the s iAScreenIndices in
                      the individualAddressScreenTable) and the group
                      address screen (all the gAScreeningAddress for the
                      s gAScreenIndices in the groupAddressScreenTable)
                      together consist of up to n addresses.  The
                      initial value of n (numberValidEntries in the
                      numberAndDefaultScreeningTable) is defined as 128.
                      In the future a value of n up to 2048 may be
                      supported.

                      The individual address screen (iAScreeningAddress
                      in the individualAddressScreenTable) is used to
                      perform Destination Address Screening for
                      individually addressed data units (performed at
                      the network ingress) and Source Address Screening
                      for all data units (performed at the network
