      DESCRIPTION 
          "This MIB contains managed object definitions for Pseudo Wire
       emulation of ATM over Packet Switched Networks(PSN).
    
           This MIB reports to the PW-MIB. The PW-MIB contains 
           structures and MIB associations generic to Pseudo-Wire 
           Virtual Circuit (VC) emulation. VC-specific MIBs (such as 
           this) contain config and stats for specific VC types."
