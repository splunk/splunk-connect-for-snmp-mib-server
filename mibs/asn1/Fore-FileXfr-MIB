	DESCRIPTION
             "This MIB module defines the FORE Systems generic
             file transfer information.  It provides for a file
             transfer table.  Each table entry contains the
             information necessary for a device to complete
             a file transfer.  Each table entry also contains
             information as to the status of the file transfer."
