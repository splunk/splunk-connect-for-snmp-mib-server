    DESCRIPTION
    "The ap553 Line Statistics 24 hour history table. This table is comprised
    of 96 objects, each of which hold T1 Line statistics data for a 15 minute
    time period.  Upon power up or after a reset, data is collected in the
    current interval object: ap553CurrentLineStats.  After 15 minutes this
    data is moved into the first of 96 historical objects.  After each sub- 
    sequent 15 minute period completes, data is moved downstream, data from
    interval #1 is moved into interval #2, etc.  The number of valid history
    intervals contained in ap553ValidLineStatsIntervals is incremented. The
    ap553TotalLineStats object is recalculated after each 15 minute interval
    completes, summing all valid interval data into this object.  When all
    96 objects have been filled, containing 24 hours of data, the oldest
    object, #96, will be overwritten by object #95, at the completion of the
    next 15 minute interval.  In this fashion, the unit is able to maintain
    a current 24 hour history of Line Statistics data."
