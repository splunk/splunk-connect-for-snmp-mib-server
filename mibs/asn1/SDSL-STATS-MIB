--      It was the consensus of the review team that this file is 
--      acceptable with the few indicated modifications
--      (note that the low number of comment is greatly due to the fact

--
--      Comments:
--      1) -    Misuse of the word "Card" instead of Port in some comments.
--      2) -    Use "Far End" and "Near End" instead of "Atuc" and "Atur" 
--              inherited from ASDL Mib in almost all object names.
--      3) -    Split second Table "nncSdslNearEndTable" too big for SNMP v1 
--              in 4 smaller Tables "Raw", "Curr15Min", "Curr1Day", "Prev1Day".
--      4) -    Add "nnc" prefix to each object name to emphasize the fact that
--              this Mib is a Newbridge Private Mib.
