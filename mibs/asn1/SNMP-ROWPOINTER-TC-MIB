      DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module defines textual conventions similar to the
        RowPointer textual convention, with additional sementics."

      REVISION     "200012180000Z" -- December 18, 2000
      DESCRIPTION
          "Initial version, published as RFCnnnn."
      ::= { mib-2 67890 } -- to be assigned by IANA


   StaticRowPointer ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS       current
       DESCRIPTION
               "Like a RowPointer, this textual convention
               represents a pointer to a conceptual row.
               The value is the name of the instance of the
               first accessible columnar object in the
               conceptual row.

               The additional semantics of this textual
               convention, relative to RowPointer, are
               related to the creation of instance-specific
               objects by cloning.  The objects being cloned
               may either be special ones that express
               configuration information at the
               mechanism-specific level, or simply
               instance-specific ones that already exist at
               the time the cloning is done.  When an object
               with the syntax StaticRowPointer is cloned, the
               StaticRowPointer in the newly cloned object is
               set to point to the same conceptual row that the
               StaticRowPointer in the cloned-from object
               pointed to. The cloning operations may be
               accomplished either with the script-based
               technique defined by SNMP Configuration, or by
               ordinary SNMP Get and Set operations.

               When cloning is not involved, this textual
               convention behaves identically to the RowPointer
               textual convention.  Specifically, once an object
               with this syntax has been created, either by
               cloning or by other means, its value may be
               updated in the same way that the value of any
               other object with read-write or read-create
               access may be updated."
