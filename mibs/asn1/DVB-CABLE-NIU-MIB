            Any IP packet can theoretically match multiple rows of 
            this table.  When considering a packet, the table is 
            scanned in row index order (e.g. filter 10 is checked 
            before filter 20).  If the packet matches that filter

            actions appropriate to dvbNiuIpFilterAction and 
            dvbNiuIpFilterActionPtr are taken.  If the packet was
