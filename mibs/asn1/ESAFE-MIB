            device, in accordance with the directives provided in the
            eSAFE specification. 

            If esafeDevServiceIntImpact is set to significant (1), it 
            indicates that the corresponding eSAFE device (as per the
            eSAFE specification) identifies a significant impact on the

            level is highly recommended for critical or real-time
            services, though the impact assessment is left to the
            directives provided by the associated eSAFE specification.

            If esafeDevServiceIntImpact is set to none (2), it
            indicates that the corresponding eSAFE device (as per the
            eSAFE specification) identifies no significant impact on
            the services offered at the given point in time.

            If esafeDevServiceIntImpact is unsupported(3), it indicates
            that the corresponding eSAFE device has no known interfaces
            to support this feature or the eSAFE specification does not
            recommend this feature. 

            If the eSAFE specification specifies the use of this
            mechanism then it MUST define definitive states for the
            impacts (significant or none) and the value of
            unsupported(3) MUST not be used by the eDOCSIS device 
            for that eSAFE interface. 

            However, if the corresponding eSAFE specification does not
            provide any directives then the value MUST be set to
            unsupported(3).

            If there exists multiple services being offered by an eSAFE
            device (Either multiple services or multiple instances of
            the same service), this MIB MUST indicate the highest

            the eRouter eSAFE element is currently operating 
            with the IPv4 protocol stack operational, is
            forwarding IPv4 traffic, and is not running an

            This object can only be set via an SNMP management
            Station.  This object cannot be included in the eCM
            configuration file.

            is instructed to switch to IP Protocol Disabled Mode 
            and transparently bridge all traffic as described in
            the eRouter Initialization section of the CableLabs
            IPv4 and IPv6 eRouter Specification.
 
            When this object is set to ipv4Only(2), the eRouter
            is instructed to switch to IPv4 Protocol Enabled Mode.

            When this object is set to ipv6Only(3), the eRouter
            is instructed to switch to IPv6 Protocol Enabled Mode.

            When this object is set to ipv4AndIpv6(4), the eRouter

            Mode Encoding encapsulated in the eCM Config File under 
            TLV 202 as described in the Configuration of eRouter 
            Operational Parameters section of the CableLabs eRouter
