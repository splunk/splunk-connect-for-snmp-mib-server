      DESCRIPTION
         "This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
         (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
         community.  In particular, it defines Textual Conventions to
         represent commonly used Path Computation Element (PCE)
         management information.  The intent is that these TEXTUAL
         CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used in PCE related MIB
         modules to avoid duplicating conventions."

   -- 'experimental 9999' is a temporary root for running smilint.

      DESCRIPTION
         "The LDP identifier is a six octet quantity which is used to
         identify a PCE client."
      SYNTAX OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..6))

   PceRoutingDomainID ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
      STATUS current
      DESCRIPTION
         "A PCE-DOMAINS information element or a A PCE-DEST-DOMAINS
         information element carries the identifier of a routing domain
         (area, as) which type depends on both the routing protocol and
         on the version of Internet protocol in use in this routing
         domain.

         This TC defines a common SMI type for the different kinds of
         routing domain identifiers.

         A PceRoutingDomainID value is always interpreted within the
         context of an AddressFamilyNumbers value.  Every usage of the
         PceRoutingDomainID textual convention is required to specify
         the AddressFamilyNumbers object which provides the context.

         The value of an PceRoutingDomainID object must always be
         consistent with the value of the associated
         AddressFamilyNumbers object.

         Following is the mapping between AddressFamilyNumbers type and
         PceRoutingDomainID size:
            ipV4(1):
               PceRoutingDomainID is an InetAddressIPv4 corresponding to
               the name of an OSPF area;
            ipV6(2):
               PceRoutingDomainID is an InetAddressIPv6 corresponding to
               the name of an OSPF area;
            nsap(3):
               PceRoutingDomainID type is OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..20)),
               corresponding to the name of an ISIS area (see RFC 1195);
            asNumber(18)
               PceRoutingDomainID type is OCTET STRING (SIZE (2))
               corresponding to the name of an Autonomous System.
