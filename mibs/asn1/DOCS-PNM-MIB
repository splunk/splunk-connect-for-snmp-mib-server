     DESCRIPTION
        "This attribute represents the overall status of the PNM test platform.
        Individual tests, within the PNM test suite, have their own specific
        objects to start and stop. For each test defined by the data-type
        enumeration for 'PnmCmCtlTest', the CM must first check the status of this
        object before starting. If this object is set to any value other than
        'ready', the CM must not start the test. If the CM was not able to start
        the test and the test has a 'MeasStatusType' object, the CM must set the
        'MeasStatusType' to a value of 'resourceUnavailable'.

        If the test is allowed to start, the CM must change the value of this
        object to 'testInProgress'. When the test is no longer in progress, the
        CM must change the value of this object to a value other than
        'testInProgress'.

        This mechanism serves to allow only one instance of only one test to
        run at a time. There may be some tests that are not included by
        this control object. That is, if any test is not defined by the
        data-type enumeration for 'PnmCmCtlTest', then it is not included
        (unless otherwise stated by the test definition) and is not required to
        check or to change this object. If a test is not included or covered by
        this set of objects, then it is allowed to run regardless of any
        other tests in progress.

        The possible values for this object are:
          'other' - Any condition not otherwise defined
          'ready' - The PNM platform is capable and ready to support a test.
                    A test can be initiated
          'testInProgress' - A PNM test is currently in progress
          'tempReject' - A temporary condition exists that prohibits a test
                         from starting, e.g., DBC

     STATUS      current
     DESCRIPTION
        "The purpose of downstream symbol capture is to provide partial
        functionality of a network analyzer to analyze the response of the
        cable plant from the CM's perspective.

        At the CM, the received I and Q time-domain samples of one full OFDM
        symbol before the FFT, not including the guard interval, are captured
        and made available for analysis. This capture will result in a number
        of data points equal to the FFT length in use, time aligned for receiver
        FFT processing. The number of captured samples can be reduced for
        narrower channels if the sampling rate, which is implementation dependent,
        is reduced. The capture includes a bit indicating if receiver windowing
        effects are present in the data. The time domain samples are expressed
        as 16 bit two's complement numbers using s3.12 format. The CM samples are
        scaled such that the average power of the samples is approximately 1, in
        order to avoid excessive clipping and quantization noise.

        Capturing the input and output of the cable plant is equivalent to a
        wideband sweep of the channel, which permits full characterization of
        the linear and nonlinear response of the downstream plant. The MAC
        provides signaling via the PLC Trigger Message to ensure that the same
        symbol is captured at the CMTS and CM.

        The Downstream Symbol Capture is controlled by setting the
        'docsPnmCmDsOfdmSymTrigEnable' object. The status of the capture is
        obtained by reading the value of the 'docsPnmCmDsOfdmSymMeasStatus'
        object.

        This table will have a row for each ifIndex for the modem. "

        a Group ID matching the CM's 'docsPnmCmDsOfdmSymTrigGroupId'. The

        disabled when a PLC containing a Group ID matching the CM's
        'docsPnmCmDsOfdmSymTrigGroupId' in a Trigger Message Block is received.

        If this attribute is set to a value of 'false' the CM must stop
        looking for the presence of the Trigger Message Block in the PLC with
        a Group ID matching the CM's 'docsPnmCmDsOfdmSymTrigGroupId'. In this

        - This object returns 'inconsistentValue' if set to 'true' while the
        CM is in DOCSIS Light Sleep (DLS) mode or the CM is in battery-backup mode.

        'docsPnmCmDsOfdmSymTrigEnableTimeout', and 'docsPnmCmDsOfdmSymTrigGroupId'
        objects are defined; thus, this object may be set to 'true' without
        explicitly setting these values. Care should be taken to insure these values
        are correct for the desired test case.

        - Setting this attribute to a value of 'true' will change the value of the
        'docsPnmCmDsOfdmSymMeasStatus' attribute to 'busy'. "

        to set this value while the value of 'docsPnmCmOfdmChEstCoefMeasStatus' is
        'busy' will return 'inconsistentValue'.

        If the value of this object is the DEFVAL (empty string), then a default
        filename value will be used. Otherwise the value set will be used as
        the filename. If a default filename is generated, then that
        value will be returned in this object and will represent the
        filename that was used for the test. All subsequent tests should
        set this object to a meaningful value or to an 'empty string'
        value (to generate a new default filename) before starting
        a new test.

        If a default filename value is used, it is generated as the test name
        plus the CM MAC Address plus the 'epoch time'. The epoch time (also known
        as 'unix time') is defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed

        The header is comprised of ordered fixed-length fields. Unless
        otherwise specified, the header fields contain hex values that are

        "This attribute causes the CM to begin the RxMer measurement for the
        purpose of creating a file of RxMer data. When the measurement is
        complete the FileEnable attribute is set internally to 'false' by the CM.

        Interaction with other table rows:

        - This object is subject to the rules specified by the
        'docsPnmCmCtlStatus' object. Therefore this object returns
        'inconsistentValue' if set to 'true' while the value of
        'docsPnmCmCtlStatus' is any value other than 'ready'.

        - Setting this value to 'true' will change the value of the
        'docsPnmCmDsOfdmRxMerMeasStatus' to 'busy' while the test is in progress.

        - This object returns 'inconsistentValue' if set to 'true' while the
        CM is in DOCSIS Light Sleep (DLS) mode or the CM is in battery-backup mode.

        - A default value for 'docsPnmCmDsOfdmRxMerFileName' is defined; thus,
        this object may be set to 'true' without explicitly setting this this value.

        - Setting this object to a value of 'false' instructs the CM to stop
        the measurement.

        - This object returns 'true' if the CM is actively taking a measurement.
        Otherwise it returns 'false'. "

        'busy' will return 'inconsistentValue'.

        If the value of this object is the DEFVAL (empty string), then a default
        filename value will be used. Otherwise the value set will be used as
        the filename. If a default filename is generated, then that

        filename that was used for the test. All subsequent tests should
        set this object to a meaningful value or to an 'empty string'
        value (to generate a new default filename) before starting
        a new test.

        If a default filename value is used, it is generated as the test name
        plus the CM MAC Address plus the 'epoch time'. The epoch time (also known
        as 'unix time') is defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed
        since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970.
        Hence, the format would be:

        The header is comprised of ordered fixed-length fields. Unless
        otherwise specified, the header fields contain hex values that are
        right-justified within the field. If necessary the field is left-padded

        used in the Profile and stores the value as MeasuredAvgMer.

        The CM also counts the number of MER per Subcarrier values that are
        below the threshold determined by the Required MER for the Modulation
        Order and the ThrshldOffset. The CM reports that value as

        - This object returns 'inconsistentValue' if set to 'true' while the
        CM is in DOCSIS Light Sleep (DLS) mode or the CM is in battery-backup mode.

        - A default value for 'docsPnmCmDsOfdmFecFileName' is defined; thus,
        this object may be set to 'true' without explicitly setting this value.

     DESCRIPTION
        "The purpose of the downstream histogram is to provide a measurement of
        nonlinear effects in the channel such as amplifier compression and laser
        clipping. For example, laser clipping causes one tail of the histogram
        to be truncated and replaced with a spike. The CM captures the histogram
        of time domain samples at the wideband front end of the receiver (full
        downstream band). The histogram is two-sided; that is, it encompasses
        values from far-negative to far-positive values of the samples. The
        histogram will have a minimum of 255 or 256 equally spaced bins.
        These bins typically correspond to the 8 MSBs of the wideband
        analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for the case of 255 or 256 bins.
        The histogram dwell count, a 32-bit unsigned integer, is the number of
        samples observed while counting hits for a given bin, and may have the
        same value for all bins. The histogram hit count, a 32-bit unsigned
        integer, is the number of samples falling in a given bin. The CM
        reports the dwell count per bin and the hit count per bin. When
        enabled, the CM computes a histogram with a dwell of at least 10
        million samples at each bin in 30 seconds or less. The CM continues
        accumulating histogram samples until it is restarted, disabled or times
        out. If the highest dwell count approaches its 32-bit overflow value,
        the CM stops counting and sets the docsPnmCmDsHistMeasStatus attribute to
        'sampleReady'. The CM reports the capture time of the histogram
        measurement in the Header Elements of the file for TFTP download
        using the 32-bit Universal Time Code.

     MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
     STATUS      current
     DESCRIPTION
        "This object provides access to CM upstream pre-equalizer coefficients.
        The CM pre-equalizer coefficients and the CMTS upstream adaptive
        equalizer coefficient update values, when taken together describe the
        linear response of the upstream cable plant for a given CM. During the
        ranging process, the CMTS computes adaptive equalizer coefficients based
        on upstream probes; these coefficients describe the residual channel
        remaining after any pre-equalization. The CMTS sends these equalizer
        coefficients to the CM as a set of Transmit Equalization Adjust
        coefficients as part of the ranging process.

        The CM Pre-Equalizer coefficients are expressed as 16 bit two's
        complement numbers using s2.13 format. The power averaged over all
        coefficients approximately 1, in order to avoid excessive clipping and
        quantization noise. The Pre-Equalizer coefficient update values sent to
        the CM by the CMTS in the RNG-RSP are expressed as 16 bit two's
        complement numbers using s1.14 format.

        The CM provides the capability to report its upstream pre-equalizer
        coefficients (full set or summary) upon request. The CM also provides
        the capability to also report the most recent set of Transmit
        Equalization Adjust coefficients which were applied to produce the
        reported set of upstream pre-equalizer coefficients. The CM indicates
        the status of the most recent Transmit Equalization Adjust coefficients
        sent to it by the CMTS. If the CM was able to apply the coefficients it
        sets the status to success(2). If the CM was unable to fully apply the
        adjustments (for example, due to excess tilt or ripple in the channel),
        and it was necessary for the CM to clip the coefficients, it sets the
        status to clipped(3). If the CM modified the coefficients other than by
        simply clipping them, it sets the status to other(1). If for
        some reason the CM is unable to apply the adjustments at all, it sets
        the status to rejected(4).

        The 'docsPnmCmUsPreEqFileEnable' object is used to create files. Other
        objects are updated as read.

        This table will have a row for each ifIndex for the modem."

        The 'docsPnmCmUsPreEqMeasStatus' object can be checked to determine the

        Interaction with other table rows:

        - This object is subject to the rules specified by the
        'docsPnmCmCtlStatus' object. Therefore this object returns
        'inconsistentValue' if set to 'true' while the value of
        'docsPnmCmCtlStatus' is any value other than 'ready'.

        - Setting this value to 'true' will change the value of the
        'docsPnmCmUsPreEqMeasStatus' to 'busy' while the file generation is in
        progress.

        - This object returns 'inconsistentValue' if set to 'true' while the
        CM is in DOCSIS Light Sleep (DLS) mode or the CM is in battery-backup mode.

        - Default values for 'docsPnmCmUsPreEqFileName' and
        'docsPnmCmUsPreEqLastUpdateFileName' are defined; thus, this object may be set
        to 'true' without explicitly setting these values.

        - This object returns 'true' if the CM is actively generating the files.
        Otherwise it returns 'false'.

        If the value of this object is the DEFVAL (empty string), then a default

        If a default filename value is used, it is generated as the test name

        otherwise specified, the header fields contain hex values that are
        right-justified within the field. If necessary the field is left-padded

-- This section of objects extends the Spectrum Analyzer objects that are

-- function to take advantage of the bulk-data collection mechanism and the
-- docsPnmCmCtlStatus objects defined by this MIB.
--
-- FileName, FileEnable, and MeasStatus objects are added to the
-- 'docsIf3CmSpectrumAnalysisCtrlCmd' set of attributes from the IF3 MIB.
-- Additionally, since this MIB adds the 'dsSpectrumAnalyzer' enumeration to
-- the 'docsnmCmCtlTest' object, it is expected that any Spectrum Analyzer Test
-- (defined here or by the DOCS-IF3-MIB, will now be controlled by the
-- 'docsPnmCmCtlStatus' object. This serves to limit the ability of the CM to run
-- only one test at a time.

     DESCRIPTION
        "This attribute, when set to 'true', causes the CM to begin a Spectrum
        Analysis measurement with the parameters defined by the
        docsIf3CmSpectrumAnalysisCtrlCmd set of attributes. In order to set
        this object to 'true', the Enable must already be set to 'true'.

        When the measurement is completed successfully, a file is generated
        and is made available for transfer and the MeasStatus attribute is set to
        'sampleReady'. The file will contain one complete snapshot of the spectrum
         data.

        Setting this object to a value of 'false' instructs the CM to stop
        the measurement.

        Interaction with other table rows:

         - This object is subject to the rules specified by the
        'docsPnmCmCtlStatus' object. Therefore this object returns
        'inconsistentValue' if set to 'true' while the value of
        'docsPnmCmCtlStatus' is any value other than 'ready'.

        - This object returns 'inconsistentValue' if set to 'true' while the
        CM is unable to perform a spectrum measurement for any reason. Examples
        might include DOCSIS Light Sleep (DLS) mode or battery-backup mode.

       - A default value for 'docsIf31CmSpectrumAnalysisCtrlCmdFileName' is defined;
        thus, this object may be set to 'true' without explicitly setting this value.

        - Setting this object to a value of 'true' will change the value of the
        'docsIf31CmSpectrumAnalysisCtrlCmdMeasStatus' to 'busy'. After completion,
        'docsIf31CmSpectrumAnalysisCtrlCmdMeasStatus' will be changed to reflect
        the status of the test.

        -This object will return a value of 'true' if it is actively taking a
        measurement; otherwise it returns 'false'.

         subsequent tests should set this object to a meaningful value
         or to an 'empty string' value (to generate a new default
         filename) before starting a new test.

         If a default filename value is used, it is generated as the test

        If the size of the data the CM is commanded to collect would exceed the

     DESCRIPTION
        "The DsOfdmSymbolCapture object capture provides partial
        functionality of a network analyzer to analyze the response of the
        cable plant.

        At the CMTS, the transmitted frequency-domain modulation values of one
        full OFDM symbol before the IFFT are captured and made available for
        analysis. The frequency domain samples are expressed as 16-bit two's
        complement numbers using s3.12 format. This includes the I and Q
        modulation values of all subcarriers in the active bandwidth of the
        OFDM channel, including data subcarriers, pilots, PLC preamble symbols
        and excluded subcarriers. This capture will result in a number of
        samples that depends on the OFDM channel width.

        As examples, for 50 kHz subcarrier spacing in a 192 MHz channel with 204.8
        MHz sampling rate, 3800 samples will be captured; for 25 kHz subcarrier
        spacing in a 192 MHz channel with 204.8 MHz sampling rate, 7600 samples
        will be captured; for 50 kHz subcarrier spacing in a 24 MHz channel with
        a reduced sampling rate of 25.6 MHz, 475 samples would be captured. Note:
        Excluded subcarriers in the guard band on either side of the encompassed
        spectrum are not captured.

        Capturing the input and output of the cable plant
        is equivalent to a wideband sweep of the channel, which permits full
        characterization of the linear and nonlinear response of the downstream
        plant. The MAC provides signaling via the PLC Trigger Message to ensure
        that the same symbol is captured at the CMTS and CM.

        The Downstream Symbol Capture is controlled by setting the
        'docsPnmCmtsDsOfdmSymTrigEnable' object. The status of the capture is
        obtained by reading the value of the 'docsPnmCmDsOfdmSymMeasStatus'
        object. "

        "This attribute is the name of the file with the captured symbol data at
        the CMTS that is to be downloaded using TFTP by the PNM server.

        This value can only be changed while a test is not in progress. An attempt
        to set this value while the value of 'docsPnmCmtsDsOfdmSymMeasStatus' is
        'busy' will return 'inconsistentValue'.

        If the value of this object is the DEFVAL (empty string), then
        a default filename value will be used. Otherwise the value set
        will be used as the filename. If a default filename is
        generated, then that value will be returned in this object and
        will represent the filename that was used for the test. All
        subsequent tests should set this object to a meaningful value
        or to an 'empty string' value (to generate a new default
        filename) before starting a new test.

        If a default filename value is used, it is generated as the test name
        plus a unique CCAP identifier (either a loopback address (IPv4 or IPv6)
        or FQDN), plus the 'epoch time'. The epoch time (also known as 'unix time')
        is defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed since midnight
        Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970.

        "The purpose of downstream NPR measurement is to view the noise,
        interference and intermodulation products underlying a portion of the
        OFDM signal. As an out-of-service test, the CMTS can define an exclusion
        band of zero-valued subcarriers which forms a spectral notch in the
        downstream OFDM signal for all profiles of a given downstream channel.
        The CM provides its normal spectral capture measurements, or symbol
        capture, which permit analysis of the notch depth. A possible use case
        is to observe LTE interference occurring within an OFDM band; another
        is to observe intermodulation products resulting from signal-level
        alignment issues. Since the introduction and removal of a notch affects
        all profiles, causing possible link downtime, this feature is intended
        for infrequent maintenance. "

     SYNTAX      SEQUENCE OF DocsPnmCmtsUsOfdmaAQProbeEntry
     MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
     STATUS      current
     DESCRIPTION
        "The purpose of upstream capture is to measure plant response and view
        the underlying noise floor, by capturing at least one OFDMA symbol
        during a scheduled active or quiet probe. An active probe provides the
        partial functionality of a network analyzer, since the input is known
        and the output is captured. This permits full characterization of the
        linear and nonlinear response of the upstream cable plant. A quiet probe
        provides an opportunity to view the underlying noise and ingress while
        no traffic is being transmitted in the OFDMA band being measured.

        The PNM server selects an active CM to analyze by specifying its MAC
        address, or performs a quiet probe measurement. When enabled to perform
        the capture, the CMTS selects a specified transmitting CM, or quiet
        period when no CMs are transmitting, for the capture. The CMTS sets up
        the capture as described in MULPIv3.1, selecting either an active SID
        corresponding to the specified MAC address or the idle SID, and defining
        an active or quiet probe. The active probe symbol for this capture
        normally includes all non-excluded subcarriers across the upstream OFDMA
        channel, with pre-equalization on or off as specified in the MIB. The quiet
        probe symbol normally includes all subcarriers, that is, during the quiet
        probe time there are no transmissions in the given upstream OFDMA channel.
        For the quiet probe, the CMTS captures samples of at least one full OFDMA
        symbol including the guard interval. The CMTS begins the capture with the
        first symbol of the specified probe. The sample rate is the FFT sample rate
        (102.4 Msps).

        The CMTS reports the list of excluded subcarriers, the cyclic prefix length,
        and the transmit window rolloff period in order to fully define the
        transmitted waveform. The CMTS also reports the index of the starting sample
        used by the receiver for its FFT. For possible comparison with other events,
        the CMTS reports the timestamp corresponding to the beginning of the probe.
        In the case where the P-MAPs for the OFDMA upstream being analyzed are being
        sent in an OFDM downstream, the timestamp reported is the extended timestamp,
        while in a case with OFDMA upstream channels but no OFDM downstream channels,
        the reported timestamp is the D3.0 timestamp. For an active probe, the CMTS
        reports the contents of the Probe Information Element (P-IE) message
        describing that probe. "

        If the value of this object is the DEFVAL (empty string), then
        a default filename value will be used. Otherwise the value set
        will be used as the filename. If a default filename is

        subsequent tests should set this object to a meaningful value
        or to an 'empty string' value (to generate a new default
        filename) before starting a new test.

        If a default filename value is used, it is generated as the test name

        otherwise specified, the header fields contain hex values that are

        "This table provides statistics of burst/impulse noise occurring in a
        selected narrow band. A bandpass filter is positioned in an unoccupied
        upstream band. A threshold is set, energy exceeding the threshold
        triggers the measurement of an event, and energy falling below the
        threshold ends the event. An optional feature allows the threshold to
        be set to zero, in which case the average power in the band will be
        measured. The measurement is time-stamped using the DOCSIS 3.0 field of the
        64-bit extended timestamp (bits 9-40, where bit 0 is the LSB), which
        provides a resolution of 98 ns and a range of 7 minutes.

        The CMTS provides the capability to capture the following statistics
        in a selected band up to 5.12 MHz wide: Timestamp of event, Duration of
        event, Average power of event.

        The CMTS provides a time history buffer of up to 1024 events. In steady
        state operation, a ring buffer provides the measurements of the last 1024
        events that occurred while the measurement was enabled. "

         For example, laser clipping causes one tail of the histogram to be
         truncated and replaced with a spike.
         When the UpstreamHistogram Enable attribute is set to 'true',
         the CMTS will begin capturing the histogram of time domain
         samples at the wideband front end of the receiver (full upstream
         band). The histogram is two-sided; that is, it encompasses
         values from far-negative to far-positive values of the samples.
         The histogram will have a minimum of 255 or 256 equally spaced
         bins. These bins typically correspond to the 8 MSBs of the
         wideband analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for the case of 255
         or 256 bins. The histogram dwell count, a 32-bit unsigned integer,
         is the number of samples observed while counting hits for a given bin,
         and may have the same value for all bins. The histogram hit count, a
         32-bit unsigned integer, is the number of samples falling in a given bin.
         The CMTS will report the dwell count per bin and the hit count per bin.
         When enabled, the CMTS will compute a histogram with a dwell of at least
         10 million samples at each bin in 30 seconds or less. The CMTS will
         continue accumulating histogram samples until it is restarted, disabled
         or times out. If the highest dwell count approaches its 32-bit overflow
         value, the CMTS will save the current set of histogram values and reset
         the histogram, so that in a steady-state condition a complete measurement
         is always available. "

        estimate of the received power in a specified OFDMA channel at
        the F connector input of the CMTS line card for a given user. The
        measurement is based on upstream probes, which are typically the same
        probes used for pre-equalization adjustment.

        The CMTS measures the total power of the probe subcarriers received
        from the CM.

        For channels without boosted pilots, the CCAP calculates the average
        power per subcarrier (Paverage) and then calculates the power normalized
        to 1.6 MHz as a)Paverage + 10 * log10(32) for 50 kHz subcarrier spacing,
        or as b)Paverage + 10 *log10(64) for 25 kHz subcarrier spacing.

        For channels with boosted pilots, the CCAP calculates the average power
        per subcarrier (Paverage) and then calculates the power normalized to
        1.6 MHz as a)Paverage + 10 * log10(32) + 1 dB for 50 kHz subcarrier
        spacing, or as b)Paverage + 10 *log10(64) + 0.5 dB for 25 kHz subcarrier
        spacing.

        NOTE: The CMTS would also use that adjusted value for comparison with the

        RNG-RSP. "

     DESCRIPTION
        "The upstream triggered spectrum analysis measurement provides a
        wideband spectrum analyzer function in the CMTS which can be triggered
        to examine desired upstream transmissions as well as underlying
        noise/interference during a quiet period.

        The CMTS provides wideband upstream spectrum analysis capability
        covering the full upstream spectrum of the cable plant. The CMTS can
        be made to use 100 kHz or better resolution (bin spacing) in the
        wideband upstream spectrum measurement.

        Depending on the particular CMTS implementation, variable
        upstream spectrum analysis span is possible.

        It is also possible that the CMTS will provide the collection of
        time-domain input samples as an alternative to the frequency-domain
        upstream spectrum results.

        In pre-DOCSIS-3.1 mode, the CMTS provides the ability to trigger the
        spectrum sample capture and perform spectrum analysis using the
        following modes:
            - Free running
            - Trigger on minislot count
            - Trigger on SID (service identifier)
            - Trigger during quiet period (idle SID)

        In DOCSIS 3.1 mode, the CMTS provides the ability to trigger spectrum
        sample capture and perform spectrum analysis using the following modes:
            - Free running
            - A specified timestamp value
            - Minislot Number
            - A specified MAC address defining a SID, triggering at the beginning
            of the first minislot granted to that SID
            - The idle SID, triggering at the beginning of the first minislot
            granted to that SID
            - A specified active or quiet probe symbol, triggering at the beginning
            of the probe symbol "

         OFDM DS channel. The message and resulting tests and
         requirements are defined in the OPT-REQ TLV Encodings section of
         the MULPI Spec.  To use the object the Operator or PMA
         Application uses the CM MAC address, the DsOfdmChannelCfgIndex,
         DsOfdmProfileCfgProfileId as the key to initiate a test.  The
         specific tests that are defined in MULPI are accessed with the
         ProfileTest attribute.  This attribute is a BITS data type and
         will allow one or more of the OPT tests to be configured to be
         performed by the CM.  Due to the nature of the ProfileTest
         attribute one or more tests can be requested in a single
         message and thus different amounts of data need to be
         configured in order for the OPT Message to have the required
         TLVs.

         Some of these tests perform evaluations of thresholds or
         margins.  To facilitate these evaluations by the CM, these
         values are defined in the test request or the
         OptMerThresholdCfg table."

         MER data from the CM will be recorded as a series of hex

         the CM has measured.  These values are gathered from the first

         pairs of values (subcarrierId and MER value) but just the

     DESCRIPTION
        "This attribute is used to control the trigger mode for the
         Upstream Triggered Spectrum Analysis sample capture. Values
         allowed for this attribute are listed and described below.
         Each trigger mode requires the Enable attribute to be set to
         true as well as the proper configuration settings applied which
         are applicable to the specific trigger mode.

         other: The CCAP initiates sampling the upstream spectrum as the
         result of a trigger condition not defined in this specification.

         freeRunning: The CCAP immediately initiates sampling and
         continues sampling until the length of time configured in
         attribute FreeRunDuration has transpired. Sampling terminates
         when the length of time configured in FreeRunDuration has
         elapsed or when FFT is disabled.  The interval between
         captures is RepeatPeriod, or the minimum period supported by
         the CCAP, whichever is greater.

         miniSlotCount: The CCAP initiates sampling when the minislot
         number equals the value configured for attribute MinislotCount.

         sid:The CCAP immediately initiates capturing samples
         corresponding to the Service Flow identified with the
         Service Identifier (SID) numbered with the value of
         attribute Sid. The CCAP continues to sample the configured
         upstream spectrum after being triggered on transmissions
         corresponding to the specified SID until FFT is disabled or a
         new configuration is applied.

         idleSid: The CCAP immediately initiates capturing samples
         during an idle period selected by the CCAP. The CCAP will
         continue to sample the configured upstream spectrum during
         transmissions corresponding to the idle SID until FFT is
         disabled or a new configuration is applied.

         cmMacAddr: The CCAP immediately initiates sampling data on a
         grant for any SID assigned to the cable modem whose MAC address
         is the value of attribute CmMac. The CCAP continues to sample
         the configured upstream spectrum during transmissions
         corresponding to the configured CM MAC until FFT is disabled
         or a new configuration is applied.

         quietProbeSymbol: The CCAP immediately initiates sampling data
         when a configured OFDMA Quiet Probe Symbol occurs. The CCAP
         will continue to sample the configured upstream spectrum during
         Quiet Probe Symbols until FFT is disabled or a new
         configuration is applied.
         The Upstream Triggered Spectrum Capture test with
         quietProbeSymbol trigger is different from the Upstream Capture
         for Active and Quiet Probes PNM feature in that the Upstream
         Triggered Spectrum Capture test is more general than the Upstream
         Capture for Active and Quiet Probes test. Upstream Triggered
         Spectrum Capture test can be done in any band, while the Upstream
         Capture for Active and Quiet Probes test is specifically for an
         OFDMA channel.

         burstIuc: The CCAP immediately initiates sampling when the CCAP
         issues the grant for the configured burst Interval Usage Code.
         The CCAP will continue to sample the configured upstream
         spectrum during transmissions corresponding to the configured
         IUC until FFT is disabled or a new configuration is applied.

         timestamp: The CCAP initiates sampling when the configured
         timestamp occurs. The CCAP will continue to sample the
         configured upstream spectrum until FFT is disabled or a new
         configuration is applied; however, a single capture typically
         is made in this mode. This is the DOCSIS 3.1 timestamp defined
         in MULPIv3.1.

         Note that if the CCAP supports only one set of Upstream
         Triggered Spectrum Capture configuration, then if a test is
         configured with timestamp trigger it effectively blocks any
         other test setup and execution until it completes since setting
         up the other test will overwrite the timestamp test
         configuration."

     DESCRIPTION
        "This attribute is used to trigger an Upstream Triggered
         Spectrum Capture. Setting this attribute to true applies
         all configured upstream triggered spectrum sample capture
         attributes and initiates the triggered upstream spectrum sample
         capture and sample output conversion process.
         Read-write attributes, which are used to configure the Upstream
         Triggered Spectrum Capture, can only be configured while a test
         is not in progress.
         The CCAP MUST reject any attempt to modify a
         UsTriggeredSpectrumCaptureCfg table attribute, or
         UsTriggeredSpectrumCaptureCtrl table attribute for the same
         instance of InitiateTest configured to true when the triggered
         spectrum capture is in progress as indicated by value 'busy'
         for MeasStatus.

         The CCAP MUST allow writable UsTriggeredSpectrumCaptureCfg
         table attributes, or UsTriggeredSpectrumCaptureCtrl table
         attributes to be modified if the value of attribute MeasStatus
         for the instance is not 'busy'.
         The CCAP initiates an upstream triggered spectrum sample capture
         only if Enable bit 1 is set to true, InitiateTest is set to
         true and all of the UsTriggeredSpectrumCaptureCfg configuration
         attributes are properly configured. Refer to section 7.3.4.1.6 and
         Table 1 of the Reference.
         While a test is in progress, this attribute returns the value
         true. Configuring a value of false for this attribute, while a
         test is in progress, will abort the currently executing test.
         If a test is aborted, the result data is discarded."
