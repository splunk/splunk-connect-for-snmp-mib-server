          - 'other' indicate operation that is not defined by

            packets between the port and the PW independent of their 
            structure (i.e. there is no service delimiting VLAN tags 
            from the PE standpoint).  
   
          - 'noChange' indicates that the PW contains the original 
             user VLAN, as specified in pwVcEnetPortVlan, i.e. the 
             VLAN on the PE-CE link is the service delimiting tag 
             and is kept as is on the PW. This is allowed only for 
             pwVcType equal 'ethernetTagged'.

            may be different than the VLAN field on the user's  
            port. the VLAN on the PE-CE link is the service delimiting 
            tag but has a different value on the PW. 
   
          - 'removeVlan' indicates that the encapsulation on the  
            PW does not include the service delimiting VLAN field.  
            Note that PRI bits transparency is lost in this case. 
   
          - 'addVlan' indicate that a VLAN field will be added 
            on the PSN bound direction. pwVcEnetPwVlan indicates 
            the value that will be added.
