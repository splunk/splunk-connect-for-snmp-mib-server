      DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module defines a textual convention that indicates
         whether a conceptual row is reusable."

      REVISION     "200103020000Z" -- March 2, 2001
      DESCRIPTION
          "Initial version, published as RFCnnnn."
      ::= { mib-2 67890 } -- to be assigned by IANA


   ReusableRow ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS       current
       DESCRIPTION
               "This textual convention characerizes a
               conceptual row as reusable or not reusable
               for the purposes of cloning a configuration
               template.  The objects being cloned may
               either be special ones that express
               configuration information at the
               mechanism-specific level, or simply
               instance-specific ones that already exist at
               the time the cloning is done.

               The following values are defined:
                 - other(1)
                 - reusable(2): the conceptual row is
                   available to be pointed to by mulitple
                   RowPointer objects.
                 - singleUse(3): a separate copy of the
                   conceptual row is needed for each
                   RowPointer object that points to it.

               Because it represents a capability of the
               managed sytsem, rather than something that
               is configurable, an object having this syntax
               SHOULD have MAX-ACCESS of 'read-only'."

       SYNTAX  INTEGER {
                 other(1),
                 reusable(2),
                 singleUse(3)
               }
