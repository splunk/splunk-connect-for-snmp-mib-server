	MAX-ACCESS  read-only
	STATUS  current
	DESCRIPTION
	"An enumeration describing a type of Policy attribute 
	supported by this device.
	This Policy attribute's semantics is intended to make sense 
	within the context of the CajunRules application. At this 
	time, a value of 'ldap' indicates that the device
	is retrieving policy information from an LDAP server. 
	This implies that the device also implements the LDAP Group 
	defined in this MIB.

	At this time the other enumerations are informational only 
	and are intended for future enhancements.

	It should be noted that 'snmp' indicates that the policies 
	themselves are being set by SNMP. The implementation of the 
	producer/consumer handshake defined in this MIB
	in the LDAP group does NOT require the 
	lucentDevicePolicyCapabilityType to be set to 'snmp'. 

	The value 'cli' is intended for a proprietary implementation 
	of cli functionality implemented over some proprietary port. 
	This value does NOT refer to the device's implementation of a 
	local command line interface or a command line interface
	supported over a telnet interface."

	accompanying a lucentDadLDAPObject  Notification. A likely 
	use of this string would be for the receiver of this variable
	in a trap to display the string in an error log.
	If this condition has never ocurred since agent initialization,

	primary purpose of this object is to be included in the

	was last modified.  Providing  this allows a remote manager 
	to detect a change in the Policy Capabilities by polling a

	part of the Directory's Policy schema.
	This object is designed for writing to by a CajunRules 
	like manager when it has placed a new policy for retrieval
	and can be interpreted by the device as a signal to retrieve 
	this policy. By convention, this device would never be 
	written to by the agent with the exception of it
	being cleared at system initializaton time. In tandem with 
	the lucentDevicePolicyCapabilityConsumerSignal it should 
	describe the current state 
	of the device with respect to its LDAP Policy retrieval 
	behavior."

	This sequence number is part of the Directory Policy
	schema.
	This object is initialized at zero on agent reset, 
	and thereafter only written by the Policy Agent on 
	successful retrieval and parsing of a Policy Schema
	from the directory.  In tandem with the 
	lucentDevicePolicyCapabilityConsumerSignal it should 
	describe the current state of the device with respect 
	to its LDAP Policy retrieval behavior.

	By convention, the agent may set this value to 0xffff to 
	indicate an error serious enough to prohibit its enforcing
	a retrieved policy."
