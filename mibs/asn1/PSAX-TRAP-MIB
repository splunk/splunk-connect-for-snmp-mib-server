		DESCRIPTION
             		"Indicates the registration status of the device 
			server(registered, unregistered or registration 
			failed).
       			VARIABLE DEFINITIONS:
			1) timeStamp - time when the alarm occured, in 
			<sec>.<usec> format
			2) code - bitwise OR of severity, facility, errorCode,
			instanceID, severity<<28 | facility<<24 | 
			errorCode<<16 | instanceid
			3) csID - call server identifier which will be 
			returned by the call server when any device server 
			registers to it.
			4) csType - call server type, 'primary' or 'secondary'.
			(Right now this information does not come from the 
			call server. It is set to 'primary'.), value = 0 for
			primary, value = 1 for secondary
			5) registrationStatus - registered | unregistred |
			registrationFailed depending on whether the device 
			server is registered, unregistered or could not 
			register to the call server respectively.
			6) reason - {unreachable | unknown | 
			invalidParam}, indicates the cause for the 
			registration failure. 
			7) comment - Any comment sent along with this trap.
 			Severity: INFO for registration/unregistration.
