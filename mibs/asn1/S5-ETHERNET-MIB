-- Port Interconnect Control Table

s5EnPIntconTable OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX	SEQUENCE OF S5EnPIntconEntry
	MAX-ACCESS	not-accessible
	STATUS	current
	DESCRIPTION
		"A table controlling the Interconnect status
		of each managed Ethernet connectivity port that
		is connected to the same backplane network as
		each NMM agent interface. The number of entries
		is determined by the number of managed ports
		connected to backplane networks which the
		NMM's interfaces are also connected to."
	::= { s5EnMisc 1 }

s5EnPIntconEntry OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX	S5EnPIntconEntry
	MAX-ACCESS	not-accessible
	STATUS	current
	DESCRIPTION
		"A row in the Ethernet port Interconnect control table.
		Entries can not be created or deleted via SNMP."
	INDEX	{ s5EnPIntconIfIndx,
		  s5EnPIntconBrdIndx,
		  s5EnPIntconPortIndx }
	::= { s5EnPIntconTable 1 }

S5EnPIntconEntry ::= SEQUENCE {
	s5EnPIntconIfIndx INTEGER,
	s5EnPIntconBrdIndx INTEGER,
	s5EnPIntconPortIndx INTEGER,
	s5EnPIntconIntconStatus INTEGER,
	s5EnPIntconAddrCollect INTEGER
	}

s5EnPIntconIfIndx OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX	INTEGER (1..65535)
	MAX-ACCESS	read-only
	STATUS	current
	DESCRIPTION
		"The index of interface on the NMM.
		This has the same value as ifIndex for
		the interface."
	::= { s5EnPIntconEntry 1 }

s5EnPIntconBrdIndx OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX	INTEGER (1..255)
	MAX-ACCESS	read-only
	STATUS	current
	DESCRIPTION
		"The index of the board. This corresponds to
		the index of the slot containing the board."

s5EnPIntconPortIndx OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX	INTEGER (1..255)
	MAX-ACCESS	read-only
	STATUS	current
	DESCRIPTION
		"The index of the port on the board. Its
		value ranges between 1 and index of the last
		manageable port on the board."
	::= { s5EnPIntconEntry 3 }

s5EnPIntconIntconStatus OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX	INTEGER {
		other(1),
		interconnect(2)
		}
	MAX-ACCESS	read-only
	STATUS	current
	DESCRIPTION
		"The interconnection status of the port.
		This object tells whether the port is
		connected to a host or to an interconnect
		(defined to be another NMM or a bridge that
		is sending hello messages). The values are:
		  other(1)..........unknown or host
		  interconnect(2)...identified as
		                      interconnect port

		The NMM agent will assign this object the
		value other(1) on initialization. If it
		sees hello messages coming in on the port,
		it will change the interconnection status
		to be interconnect(2)."

s5EnPIntconAddrCollect OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX	INTEGER {
		default(1),
		neverCollect(2),
		alwaysCollect(3)
		}
	MAX-ACCESS	read-write
	STATUS	current
	DESCRIPTION
		"This object tells whether the NMM should
		collect node address information from this
		port for the Find Nodes and Show Nodes tables.

		By default, the node addresses are collected
		only from ports that are not identified as
		interconnect ports. This object provides a
		means of overriding the default for collection
		and checking of node addresses. The values are:
		  default(1).........follow default rules for
		                       address collection
		  neverCollect(2)....don't collect addrs,
		                       whatever intercon status
		  alwaysCollect(3)...do collect address,
		                       regardless of config

		Setting this variable to default(1) tells the
		NMM to collect and check addresses if and only
		the port has not been identified as an
		interconnect port.

		To disable node address collection
		on a port, set this object to neverCollect(2).

		To collect node addresses for an
		interconnect port, set this object to
		alwaysCollect(3).

		To restore the 'natural' value for the port,
		set this object to default(1)."

-- Show Nodes & Find Nodes Aging Timers

s5EnNodeInactInterval OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX	TimeIntervalSec (0..2147483647)
	MAX-ACCESS	read-write
	STATUS	current
	DESCRIPTION
		"The time interval in seconds used to change the
		status of an entry in the Show Nodes Table
		(found in the 5000 Common Stats MIB) from active
		to inactive. When a station has not sent a frame
		within the time interval represented by this
		object, the status for the corresponding entry
		is set to inactive."

	MAX-ACCESS	read-write
	STATUS	current
	DESCRIPTION
		"The time interval in seconds used for aging out
		entries in the Show Nodes and Find Nodes Tables
		(found in the 5000 Common Stats MIB). When a
		station has not sent a frame within the time
		interval represented by this object, the
		corresponding entry is removed from the two
		tables."
