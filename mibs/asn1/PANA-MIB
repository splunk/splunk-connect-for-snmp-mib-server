              of the VID, will be considered a match.
              A value of 'untaggedOnly(3)' indicates that only

              against the value contained in the EtherType field of an
              IEEE 802 frame. Example settings would include 'IP'
              (0x0800), 'ARP' (0x0806) and 'IPX' (0x8137).
               Setting the pana802FilterEtherTypeMin object to -1 indicates
              that EtherType data should not be considered during traffic
              classification.
              Note that the position of the EtherType field depends on
              the underlying frame format. For Ethernet-II encapsulation,
              the EtherType field follows the 802 MAC source address. For
              802.2 LLC/SNAP encapsulation, the EtherType value follows
              the Organization Code field in the 802.2 SNAP header. The
              value that is tested with regard to this filter component
              therefore depends on the data link layer frame format being
              used. If this 802 filter component is active when there is
              no EtherType field in a frame (e.g., 802.2 LLC), a match is
              implied."

              if a match exists between the data in a data link layer
              frame and the value of this 802 filter component. Multiple
              values may be set at one time such that potentially several

              component.
              Setting all of the bits that are associated with this
