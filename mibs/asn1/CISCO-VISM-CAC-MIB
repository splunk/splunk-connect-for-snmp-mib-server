    DESCRIPTION
        "This table defines the CAC success or failure statistics. 
         CAC functionality is applied on a per PVC(Permanent virtual
         circuit) basis for accepting the new calls in a switching
         model (i.e when CRCX(CreateConnection) message is received
         from the call agent) and when adding a new binding between a 
         CID(Channel Identifier) and a PVC in the AAL2 trunking 
         application ('addcid' command). In both switching and trunking
         models, the CAC functionality is applied for upspeeding the
         connections due to the detection of fax/modem tone on a 
         connection configured with voice compression. The entries in 
         this table are implicitly created and deleted with the 
         creation and deletion of entries in vismChanCnfGrpEntry
         (defined in CISCO-VISM-CONN-MIB MIB).

         the CAC functionality is applied on a per PVC basis. The
         bandwidth is allocated on a per PVC basis and the 
         connection admission control is done by comparing the 
         available bandwidth on a PVC with the required bandwidth
         as a result of new connection setup request or upspeed
         request.
