        The value of an object of this type contains a string of bits, where
        each bit corresponds to a particular data rate.  Bits start with the
        high order bit of the first octet, representing 0.5 Mbps, and are
        contiguous representing increasing data rates in increments of
        0.5 Mbps.  For example, the following bits correspond to the following
        data rates:
             Octet Bit         Mbps
             0     0x80        1
             0     0x40        1.5

        If the bit corresponding to a particular data rate is set, that rate
        is considered to be a member of the set of data rates.  The bit
        position BP for a particular data rate DR can be found using the
        following formula:
            BP = (DR * 2) - 2
        The bit value corresponding to a particular data rate can be found
        using the following formula, where BP is the bit position as above,
        and O is the array of octets returned as the value of an object of
        this type:
            bitValue = (O[BP/8] >> (7 - (BP % 8))) & 0x01
        Similarly, the bit for a particular data rate can be set as follows:
            O[BP/8] |= 0x80 >> (BP % 8)
        And cleared as follows:
            O[BP/8] &= ~(0x80 >> (BP % 8))

        Bits start with the high order bit of the first octet, representing
        channel 1, and are contiguous representing increasing channel numbers.
        For example, the following bits correspond to the following channels:

        If the bit corresponding to a particular channel is set, that channel
        is considered to be a member of the set of channels.  The bit value
