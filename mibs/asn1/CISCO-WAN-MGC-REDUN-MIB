         requesting for it. A set of events can be
         provisioned on the Gateway as persistent 
         events.

         Every event will have an action associated
         with it, which will determine, whether to
         be notified, ignored, accumulated etc..
         MGC will specify the action when 
         requesting the GW to notify the event.
         For persistent events the Action will be
         Notify. Call agent can change this by 
         explicitly requesting the event associating
         an action with it.

         During the period where the Gateway has
         received a notification acknowledgement,
         and waiting for the next Request Notification,
         events could be observed. The Quarantine 
         procedure determines what should be done with
         these events.

         This object is used to supercede the quarantine
         procedure, by enforcing loop, process as the
         quarantine procedure only for persistent events.

         When a Request Notification is received

         the first event that qualifies to be notified
         will generate a Notify message with the list

         which qualifies to be notified, the Gateway
         may notify the event, or quarantine it until
         the next Request Notification, based on the
         quarantine policy set by the MGC.

         When the MGC doesn't explicitly 
         specify the quarantine policy, the protocol
         defines the default behaviour. The default
         behaviour varies with different versions of 
         the protocol.

         will turn OFF all active signals on the endpoint
         S: T/co1
         will turn ON co1 signal.

         The configuration of this object only applies to 
         on/off signals and not for brief or timeout signals.

         MGCP 0.1 specification says if an empty signaled
         list is provided it is meant to turn off all the
         currently turned on signaled events. However
         in MGCP 1.0 specification, it says that unless
         specifically requested by the CA to turn off
         (signal is parameterized by a (-)) the signal
         cannot be turned off, in other words an
         empty signal list does imply that the currently
         active signals should be turned off.

         Although the behavior of the gateway is
         specified in the specs, some MGC 
         may not follow the MGCP 1.0 spec. Hence
         this MIB serves as an interop knob.

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object enables or disables sending provisional
         response to the CA when processing a request received
         from the CA. The provisional response to the CA
         indicates that the GW is processing the request and
         will send a final response once the processing is
         complete.

         For example, if a CRCX request from the CA using MGCP
         protocol, requires that resources be reserved along the
         bearer path using RSVP, GW would send a provisional
         response if this parameter was set to true. It would
         then wait for the RSVP procedure to complete before
         sending the final response. On the other hand, if the
         value of this parameter was set to false, the final
         response will be sent out without waiting for the
         RSVP procedure to complete. When the RSVP procedure 
         does complete, a NTFY will be sent from the GW
         indicating if the RSVP procedure was successful or not.

         The GW will receive provisional responses from the CA.
         These messages will be parsed and ignored regardless
         of this object.
 
         If the protocol supported by the CA is MGCP1.0, the
         default value for this object is 'sendProvisionalResponse'. 
         In all other cases, it is 'notSendProvisionalResponse'.

    DESCRIPTION
        "Every command from the MGC could 
         contain Response Acknowledgement attribute.
         This attribute consists a list of transaction
         IDs which are acknowledged by the Call agent.
         The gateway on receiving this can free up the
         resources attached to this transaction ID.

         When this attribute is present in the Gateway
         response, it should contain an empty list of
         transaction ID. This attribute in the response
         from the Gateway is to invite a response 
         acknowledgement message from the MGC 
         for this response. This will be present in the
         final response sent by the gateway only when a 
         provisional response had been sent prior to 
         this final response for the same transaction.

         This object determines whether the Gateway 
         should include response acknowledgement in
         the final response. This object does not 
         determine the capability of the Gateway to
         receive response acknowledgement attribute
         as part of MGC commands.

         'sendResponseAckAttr' - Gateway will include response 
             acknowledgement attribute as part of 
             final response when a provisional response 
             had been sent earlier.

         'notSendResponseAckAttr' - Gateway will not include 
             response acknowledgement attribute as part of 
             final response when a provisional response had
             been sent earlier.

         The default value will be 'sendResponseAckAttr' for 
         MGCP 1.0 protocol and 'notSendResponseAckAttr' for 
         every other protocol.
