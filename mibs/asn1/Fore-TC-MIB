-- This mib implements management information for the ATM
-- traffic convergence layer in an atm interface.  The
-- reference model for this looks like:
--
-- Cells -> AtmInterface -> TC -> Physical Interface
--
-- In the case of a DS3 carrying cells in PLCP frames
-- the model looks like
--
-- Cells -> Atm Interface -> TC -> PLCP Framer -> Phy
--
-- This mib is organized into 3 tables
--
-- Configuration Table
-- Total Table
-- Diagnostics Table
