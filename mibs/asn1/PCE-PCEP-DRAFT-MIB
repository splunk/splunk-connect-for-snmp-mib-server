    DESCRIPTION 
        " Changes from -00- draft :
         1. Clarified the notion of PCEP Client.
         2. Added new objects to the PCEP client and session tables
            to manage PCEP protocol as in section 8 of 
            draft-ietf-pce-pcep-08.txt
         3. Did not add all the objects to manage the recommendations
            in draft-ietf-pce-pcep-08.txt to control the complexity of
            the MIB."

                KeepAlive Time for this session.

                This value is negotiated during
                session initialization between
                the entity's proposed value
                (i.e., the value configured in
                pcePcepClientKeepAliveHoldTimer)
                and the peer's proposed
                KeepAlive Hold Timer value.
                This value is the smaller
                of the two proposed values."

             at which any one or more of this session's counters
             suffered a discontinuity.  The relevant counters are

             sysUpTime when the entry was created in this table.

             between a given Entity and Peer goes away and a new
             session is established.  This value would change and
             thus indicate to the command generator that this is a
             different session."
