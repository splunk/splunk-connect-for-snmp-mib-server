   DIFFSERV-POLICY-MIB DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

   -- This version of the MIB is aligned with the DiffServ WG's MIB
   -- found in draft-ietf-diffserv-mib-06.txt.  This MIB module will
   -- remain aligned with that work as updates are made.

   -- Note that much of the content of the MIBs in previous versions
   -- of this document have been removed since they were used for
   -- creating "templates" that were not bound to interface
   -- instances.  That functionality now exists in the DIFF-SERV-MIB
   -- itself.

               specific managed objects to perform policy-based
               configuration management. This MIB allows policies
               to use 'templates' to be used to instantiate
               diffserv datapath configurations to be assigned
               (associated with an interface and direction)
               when a policy is created and activated."
