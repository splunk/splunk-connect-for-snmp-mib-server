-- The WaveLAN-Roaming MIB consist of the following groups:
-- 
-- the Generic Roaming group, mandatory:
-- 	wlrGenTable	OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { wavelanRoaming 1 }
-- 
-- the Mobile Station Roaming group, optional; for mobile stations only:
-- 	wlrMsTable	OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { wavelanRoaming 2 }
-- 
-- the Access Point Roaming group, optional; for access points only:
-- 	wlrApTable	OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { wavelanRoaming 3 }
-- 

-- Some objects in this MIB represent values of timers. 
-- In this MIB, these timers have values in units of hundredth 
-- of a second (i.e. 1/100 s, or 10 ms). 
-- To avoid ambiguity, a data type is defined here as a textual
-- convention and all representation of these timers in this MIB
-- module are defined using this data type:

Timeout  ::=  INTEGER	-- a timer in units of 1/100 seconds.
