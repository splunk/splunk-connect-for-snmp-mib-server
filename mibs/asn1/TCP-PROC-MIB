-- The TCP Listener Process table

tcpListenerProcTable OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX     SEQUENCE OF TcpListenerProcEntry
    MAX-ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
           "A table containing additional information about existing
            TCP listeners. This table delivers functionality beyond
            the existing tcpListenerTable by providing an entry
            for each process that is associated with the listener
            for operating systems that support this functionality.
            An entry in the tcpListenerTable implies the existance of
            one or more entries in this table for the listener, and
            vice-versa.  A listening application can be represented
            in three possible ways:

            1. An application that is willing to accept both IPv4 and
               IPv6 datagrams is represented by
               a tcpListenerProcLocalAddressType of unknown (0) and
               a tcpListenerProcLocalAddress of ''h (a zero-length
               octet-string).

            2. An application that is willing to accept only IPv4 or
               IPv6 datagrams is represented by a
               tcpListenerProcLocalAddressType of the appropriate
               address type and a tcpListenerProcLocalAddress of
               '0.0.0.0' or '::' respectively.

            3. An application that is listening for data destined
               only to a specific IP address, but from any remote
               system, is represented by a
               tcpListenerProcLocalAddressType of an appropriate
               address type, with tcpListenerProcLocalAddress
               as the specific local address.

            NOTE: The address type in this table represents the
            address type used for the communication, irrespective
            of the higher-layer abstraction.  For example, an
            application using IPv6 'sockets' to communicate via
            IPv4 between ::ffff:10.0.0.1 and ::ffff:10.0.0.2 would
            use InetAddressType ipv4(1))."

            1. For an application willing to accept both IPv4 and

               object being unknown (0).

            2. For an application willing to accept only IPv4 or

               '0.0.0.0' or '::' respectively, with
