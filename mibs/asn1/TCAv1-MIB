    DESCRIPTION
           "The value of this object is used as one of the

           for this row in the table for this interface

    ACCESS  read-only
    STATUS  mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
           "The value of this object is the sample type of
           the counter object being thresholded from the
           perspective of the CNM or XA-OM customer.  All
           counters are thresholded over a 15-minute
           interval.  However, over this 15-minute interval
           the threshold value may be an absolute value
           (e.g., used for interval counters) or a delta
           value (e.g., used for continuous counters).  The
           intervals are measured locally at the agent, and
           are not visible to the manager. At the agent's
           local interval boundary, all threshold crossing
           measurements are reset to zero.  (A counter value
           may cross the predefined threshold and a TCA is
           sent only once within a 15-minute interval.)"

tcaCounts OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX  Counter
    ACCESS  read-only
    STATUS  mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
           "The value of this object is the number of times
           the threshold was crossed for this counter object,
           since sysUpTime was initialized or restarted.
           This counter is a continuous counter.  It should
           be noted that as this object has a SYNTAX of
           Counter, that it does not have a defined initial
           value.  However, it is recommended that this
           object be initialized to zero."
    ::= { tcaEntry  7 }

tcaTimeStamp OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX  TimeTicks
    ACCESS  read-only
    STATUS  mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
           "The value of this object is equal to the value of
           MIB-II's sysUpTime object at which last (latest)
           threshold was crossed for this counter object.
           The value of this object is set to zero at
           (re)initialization."

           The physical layer counters' and gauges' (e.g.,
           DS1, DS3, SONET, and PLCP) TCAs should have a
           default value of disabled(2).  The SMDS service
           violations and higher layer protocol violations
           counters' TCAs should have a default value of
           enabled(1).  A fyiTrap, when generated, shall have
           the following varBind list:
