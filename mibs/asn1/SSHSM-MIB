   TransportAddressSSH ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       DISPLAY-HINT "1a"
       STATUS      current
       DESCRIPTION
           "Represents either a hostname encoded in ASCII
           using the IDNA protocol, as specified in RFC3490, followed by
           a colon ':' (ASCII character 0x3A) and a decimal port number
           in ASCII, or an IP address followed by a colon ':'
           (ASCII character 0x3A) and a decimal port number in ASCII.
            The name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

            Values of this textual convention are not directly useable
            as transport-layer addressing information, and require
            runtime resolution. As such, applications that write them
            must be prepared for handling errors if such values are
            not supported, or cannot be resolved (if resolution occurs
            at the time of the management operation).

            The DESCRIPTION clause of TransportAddress objects that may
            have TransportAddressSSH values must fully describe how (and
            when) such names are to be resolved to IP addresses and vice
            versa.

            This textual convention SHOULD NOT be used directly in
            object definitions since it restricts addresses to a
            specific format. However, if it is used, it MAY be used
            either on its own or in conjunction with
            TransportAddressType or TransportDomain as a pair.

            When this textual convention is used as a syntax of an
            index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
            sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58. In this case,
            the OBJECT-TYPE declaration MUST include a 'SIZE' clause
            to limit the number of potential instance sub-identifiers."
       SYNTAX      OCTET STRING (SIZE (1..255))

    transportDomainSSH OBJECT-IDENTITY
       STATUS      current
       DESCRIPTION
           "The SSH transport domain. The corresponding transport
           address is of type TransportAddressSSH.

           When an SNMP entity uses the transportDomainSSH transport
           mapping, it must be capable of accepting messages up to
           and including 8192 octets in size.  Implementation of
           larger values is encouraged whenever possible."
