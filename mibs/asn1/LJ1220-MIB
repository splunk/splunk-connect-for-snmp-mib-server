                Host sets to this state to indicate it wants to cancel the job.  Device
                will abort the job.
                
                eCopierSetup - indicates the host wants to set up job settings for a copy
                job.  Host sets to this state to then access copier job settings objects.
                Device does not set to this state.  Object can only transition to this state

              described by this row of the table.  A value
              unknown(1) indicates that the current state of the

              device is up and running and that no unusual error
              conditions are known.  The warning(3) state
              indicates that agent has been informed of an
              unusual error condition by the operational software
              (e.g., a disk device driver) but that the device is
              still 'operational'.  An example would be high
              number of soft errors on a disk.  A value of
              testing(4), indicates that the device is not
              available for use because it is in the testing
              state.  The state of down(5) is used only when the
              agent has been informed that the device is not
              available for any use.

               7, the most significant bit of the second byte
               being bit 8, and so on.  A one bit encodes that
               the condition was detected, while a zero bit
               encodes that the condition was not detected.
               This object is useful for alerting an operator to

    DESCRIPTION
                "Writing this object allows a device self test to be

                what self-test is currently executing, if any.  Actual
                self-test operation is device specific.  A self test may
                not be allowed at any arbitrary time.  If the device
                supports the requested self test, but can not start the
                execution of the self test when requested, the device
                will respond with <genErr>.  If
                a non-destructive self test is being started, the device
                will generate a response before the self test is
                completed.
                RECOMMENDATION:  If the device is ready (i.e. the NOT-
                READY-PRINTER object does not contain any items, except
                maybe being off-line) and is idle (i.e. the NOT-IDLE
                object does not contain any items), this request should
                always succeed.  This provides a mechanism for driver
                writers to always determine if the action will succeed
                or not.
                Additional information:
                The eNonDestructiveSelfTest performs
                limited testing on the printer and its attached paper
                handling devices.  After the self-test is complete a
                configuration page is printed.  The recommended way to
                cause a configuration page to be printed is to use the
                PRINT-INTERNAL-PAGE object.  A continuous self test
                cannot be started or terminated using this OID.  
                
                When the printer is idle, setting this object to
                eNonDestructiveSelfTest results in a status of <noError> and
                a value of eNonDestructiveSelfTest being returned.  If
                the printer is not idle (whether printing an external
                job, printing an internal page or running self test), a
                status of <genErr> status will
                be returned with a value of eNotInASelfTest.  
                
                When the printer is idle, setting this object to
                eNonDestructiveSelfTest causes the configuration page to
                be formatted and put in the printer's print queue.  
                
                Attempting to set this object before the configuration

    DESCRIPTION
                "Writing this object to a value other than
                eNotPrintingAnInternalPage causes the device to attempt
                to print an internally generated page.  Reading this
                object provides an indication what internally generated
                page is currently being printed, if any.  The actual
                page is device specific.  Some devices may support
                continuously printing an internally generated page.
                Setting this object to eNotPrintingAnInternalPage
                terminates continuously printing internally generated
                pages.  An internally generated page may not be allowed
                to be printed at any arbitrary time; under what
                conditions it will succeed or fail is device specific.
                If the device supports the requested page, but can not
                start printing the page when requested, the device will
                respond with <genErr>.
                RECOMMENDATION:  If the device is ready (i.e. the NOT-
                READY-PRINTER object does not contain any items, except
                maybe being off-line) and is idle (i.e. the NOT-IDLE
                object does not contain any items), this request should
                always succeed.  This provides a mechanism for driver
                writers to always determine if the action will succeed
                or not.
                Additional information:
                eDeviceDemoPage2 is the printer demo page.
                ePCLFontList1 is the PCL typeface list,
                ePostScriptFontList1 is the PostScript font list, and
                eDeviceDemoPage1ConfigurationPage is the selftest page.
                Laserjet 1220 does not support continuously
                printing a demo page.    
                
                The printer will queue requests if it is currently busy.  
                
                When this object is set to a valid value and the printer
                is idle, the status returned is <noError> and the value
                returned is ePrintingAnUnknownInternalPage.  
                
                Setting this object to a valid value causes the desired
                page to be formatted and put in the printer's print
                queue.  While the page is being formatted, and the
                printer remains in a testing state, a get on this object
                will return the value ePrintingAnUnknownInternalPage.
                The return value will be eNotPrintingAnInternal page if
                the printer is not in a testing state, and the internal
                page is done being formatted.  
                
                The user will not be able to set
                eNotPrintingAnInternalPage or
                ePrintingAnUnknownInternalPage, and the return status
                will be <badValue> with a return
                value of eNotPrintingAnInternalPage.  
                
                ePostScriptFontList1 will not be a valid value unless
                postscript is installed in the printer.  If postscript
                is not installed and the user attempts to set
                ePostScriptFontList1, the return status will be
                <badValue> with a return value of
                eNotPrintingAnInternalPage.  
                
                Setting through DMCMD will cause a 15 second delay in
                printing."

    DESCRIPTION
                "Returns the current value of an object in the job-info

                identifier for the object whose value has changed as
                job-info.required-field.optional-field.job-id.  job-info
                represents the OID prefix of all objects in the job-info
                sub-tree.  Required-field represents the OID field value
                that follows the job-info prefix.  Since some objects in
                the job-info sub-tree have two OID fields between the
                job-info prefix and the job-id, the optional-field
                represents the OID field between the required-field and
                the job-id field, if present.  Using this definition,
                the format for the JOB-INFO-CHANGE-ID binary value can
                be described as follows:   
                  Bytes  0-3 :  required-field  
                  Bytes  4-7 :  optional-field, or all zeros if there   
                                is no optional field

                All multi-byte values stored in Motorola (big-endian)
                format, where the most significant byte occurs first.
                Additional information:
                Laserjet 1220 will use this object
                to report changes of the job-info-pages-printed and
                job-info-state objects.  The required-field (bytes 0
                through 3) will designate whether the change to be
                reported involves the pages printed (13) or job state
                (15).  The optional-field (bytes 4 through 7) will
                always be zeroes.  The value-field (bytes 12 through 15)
                will contain the new value for pages printed or job
                state cast to a 32-bit integer."

    DESCRIPTION
                "Contains the printer assigned job identification for the
                job currently being processed by the processing PDL sub-
                system.  The job ID is a monotonically increasing
                number.  The job ID may be reset to zero at power-up and
                may roll over to zero after reaching some maximum
                value.
                Additional information:
                A value of -1 is returned when the printer
                is not parsing a job.  
                
                When data for a new job is detected, this object is
                updated (the job may or may not turn out to be a Null
                Job); however, the trap does not occur until the printer
                determines that it is not a Null Job.  (A job is
                considered to be a 'null job' if it has no name or job
                attribute, causes no pages to be printed, and consumes
                MIN_JOB_SIZE (9) or fewer bytes.)  A trapped value will
                differ from the previous value by one or more.  See the
                Job Boundary ERS for details on what constitutes a job
                boundary.  
                
                Some job-info- objects are created when the first data
                bytes are received.  If the printer determines that the
                job is a Null Job, the job-info- objects related to the
                Null Job are deleted. Laserjet 1220 retains the
                job-info- objects for the MAX_JOBS_IN_LIST (12) most
                recent jobs that are not Null Jobs.  
                
                The first job received after power-up will have job ID 1,
                and the job ID will increment to 32767 before rolling 
                to zero.  To distinguish whether a power cycle or a 
                rollover causes a reduction in the job ID value, the 
                object prtGeneralConfigChanges can be watched and if it 
                increments at the same time as the drop is observed in
                the value of CURRENT-JOB-PARSING-ID, then a power cycle
                is the most likely cause."

                ''Closest'' means the smallest absolute difference.

                The default of 1200 is a font point size of 12.  
                
                
                Supported values range from 400 to 99975.  Setting to an
                unsupported value causes the printer to substitute in a

                Laserjet 1220 supports 4 fuser temperatures.
                Zero (0) is the default temperature, one (1) is a higher

                Additional information:
                Laserjet 1220 only supports

                In the Laserjet 1220, the supported values are 0 and
                100.  A value of zero has the lowest print quality
                (ECONOMODE=ON), thus minimizes the amount of toner used
                to print a page.  A value of 100 has the highest print
                quality (ECONOMODE=OFF), thus uses more toner to print a
                page.  Setting to an unsupported value outside of the 0
                to 100 range causes the printer to return
                <badValue> status.  
                
                Setting to an unsupported value inside of the 0 to 100

                may set object to this state at any time.  Device sets
                object to this state only upon initial power up but will
                otherwise never set to this state of its own accord.  
                  eScanUploadStart - indicates host requesting to
                commence a scan to host operation.  Host may set object
                to this state from eScanUploadIdle or
                eScanUploadNewPage.  Device will not set object to this
                state of its own accord.

                indicate host may commence receiving scanned image data.
                During this state, the device will be writing scanned
                image data to the I/O channel.  
                  eScanUploadAborted - indicates the scanning and scan
                upload activity has terminated in error state.  This
                value is set by the device.  This state is not settable
                by the host.  The host should transition this state to
                eScanUploadIdle.  
                  eScanUploadDone - indicates the device is signaling
                successful completion of scan upload activity and there
                are no more document pages in the scanner/ADF.  The
                application should set this object to eScanUploadIdle.

                current page and there remains at least one page in the
                scanner/ADF available for scanning.  Host may choose to
                begin scan upload cycle by setting object to
                eScanUploadStart or end the cycle by setting object to
                eScanUploadIdle.

                of scan upload activity for the current page. There
                may be a page in the device or not.  The device will
                wait to prefeed another page until the application sets
                the object to eScanUploadStart.  This was to fix
                a bug on Timberline that a prefed page would cause a jam
                if the application set the object to eScanUploadIdle.  
                The application could not create another scan job until
                the prefed page was removed.
                
                Host may choose to begin scan upload cycle by 
                setting object to eScanUploadStart or end the cycle

        accompanying description must specify the encoding and
        interpretation of the prtChannelInformation value for the
        channel type.  prtChannelInformation semantics for an existing
        PrtChannelType may be added or amended in the same manner as
        described in section 2.4.1 for type 2 enumeration values.
        The prtChannelInformation specifies values for a collection of
        channel attributes, represented as text according to the
        following rules: 
         1. The prtChannelInformation is coded in the NVT ASCII
            character set.  It is not affected by localization. 
         2. The prtChannelInformation is a list of entries representing
            the attribute values.  Each entry consists of the following
            items, in order: 
             a. a keyword, composed of alphabetic characters (A-Z,
                a-z), that identifies a channel attribute,
             b. an Equals Sign (=) to delimit the keyword,
             c. a data value, consisting of NVT ASCII graphics
                characters (codes 32-126),
             d. a Line Feed character (code 10) to delimit the data
                value. 
            No other characters shall be present. 
            Keywords are case-sensitive.  Conventionally, keywords are
            capitalized (including each word of a multi-word keyword),
            and, since they occupy space in the prtChannelInformation,
            they are kept short. 
         3. If a channel attribute has multiple values, it is
            represented by multiple entries with the same keyword, each
            specifying one value.  Otherwise, there shall be at most
            one entry for each attribute. 
         4. By default, entries may appear in any order.  If there are
            ordering constraints for particular entries, these must be
            specified in their definitions. 
         5. The prtChannelInformation value may represent information
            that is not normally coded in textual form, or that is coded
            in a character set other than NVT ASCII.  In these cases,
            whatever symbolic representation is conventionally used for
            the information should be used for encoding the
            prtChannelInformation.  (For instance, a binary port value
            might be represented as a decimal number, Unicode would
            be represented in UTF-8 format.) 
         6. For each PrtChannelType for which prtChannelInformation
            entries are defined, the descriptive text associated with the
            PrtChannelType enumeration value shall specify the following
            information for each entry: 
            Title:          Brief description phrase, e.g.: 'Port name',
                            'Service Name',
            Keyword:        The keyword value, eg: 'Port', 'Service'
            Syntax:         The encoding of the entry value, if it
                            cannot be directly represented by NVT ASCII,
            Status:         'Mandatory', 'Optional', or 'Conditionally
                            Mandatory',
            Multiplicity:   'Single' or 'Multiple', to indicate whether
                            the entry may be present multiple times,
            Description:    Description of the use of the entry, other
                            information required to complete the
                            definition (e.g.: ordering contstraints,
                            interactions between entries). 
        Applications that interpret prtChannelInformation should ignore
        unrecognized entries, so they are not affected if new entry
        types are added.
