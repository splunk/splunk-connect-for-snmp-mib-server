    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "The tunnel table is used to configure and monitor VPN
        tunnels. There two cases here: site-to-site and remote
        dial-in. For site-to-site VPN the entry in the tunnel table
        must be configured. There are two types of tunnels: static
        tunnels and dynamic tunnels. When dynamic tunnels are
        configured and become operational, the ISAKMP protocol 
        creates an SA pair, one inbound and one outbound.

        When static tunnels are configured, inbound and outbound
        SAa need to be created through network management. In this 
        case key and peer SPI (security profile index) must be set. 
        Static SAs are like ATM PVCs. Dynamic SAs are like ATM SVCs.
        
        All dial-in clients are organized into user groups. One or
        more users (dial-in clients) may be in the group. All dial-in
        users that are members of the same group get the same security
        attributes. Actual users may be either configured internally
        (in the ipsecRemoteClient table) or in the external database
        such as X.500 directory or Radius, etc. The administrator has
        an option of defining a Default group. Users that do not have
        any User group membership are assigned into a Default group.
        
        For remote dial-in VPNs, the tunnel entries are first
        statically configured for every defined user group, for
        example XediaEngineering, etc. Tunnels for individual users in
        the group are created automatically when user of the group
        initiates a connection. These automatically created remote
        client tunnels are 'children' of a statically configured
        'parent' user group tunnel. The name of automatically created
        dial-in tunnel (which must be unique) is constructed as
        follows: tunnelName.userName, for example
        XediaEngineering.schwartz.
        
        For site-to-site and dial-in-group tunnel VPNs the objects'
        access is as specified. For dial-in 'children' tunnel VPNs which
        are automatically created by the system, all objects are
        read-only except for ipsecTunnelAdminStatus. This object has
        write access and when set to down, it would result in tearing
        down user dial-in session, i.e. all security associations for
        this dial-in client will be deleted."
