                    There is still some question where under the products tree this
                    belongs the chassisManagement tree would be logical *if* there
                    is possibility of either the Multi-Flex Server chassis will be allowed
                    a 3rd party CMM, or if the CMM may be put in a 3rd party
                    chassis.   It appears that initially that neither is the case
                    and that Multi-Flex Server will remain solely an SMB unit.  Thus, it
                    may be placed by itself under the smb tree"
