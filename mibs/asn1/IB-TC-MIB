          "Identifies an InfiniBand (IB) Port.  The InfiniBand 
           Architecture (IBA) defines a maximum of 254 physical ports  
           numbered Port 1 to Port 254.  A port is the location on a  
           Channel Adapter, IB Router, or IB Switch to which a link is 
           connected.  If a device has N ports, the physical ports are  
           always numbered from 1 to N.  The relationship between an  
           InfiniBand port and an ifIndex is one-to-one.  As such, the  
           value of an ifIndex object instance can be directly used to  
           identify corresponding instances of the objects defined  
           herein as IB ports.  Note: this definition does include  
           enhanced switch port 0 but not base switch port 0. In the 
           case of a switch with enhanced switch port 0, the ifIndex is 
           offset by 1 from the ibPort. In all other cases, the ifIndex 
           is identical to the ibPort."
