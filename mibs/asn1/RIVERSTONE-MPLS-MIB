        "A pointer to a conceptual row in the mplsXCTable.

         This object is set to the ZeroDotZero OID by default.  This
         object is valid only in case of Ingress LSRs.

         If the LSP identified by this cross-connect is a primary, and 
         when this LSP goes down, and if there is a secondary LSP, this
         cross-connect is not torn down.  In stead, the mplsXCOperStatus
         will be set to down, the mplsOutSegmentTopLabel identified by
         the out segment of the cross-connect is set to 0 (invalid label).
         At this time, this object is set to point to the cross-connect
         which acts as the secondary LSP.

         Note that, this is the last resort.  First the mpls engine will
         try to use a detour.  If no detours are configured or up, then
         only will it use the secondary LSP."
