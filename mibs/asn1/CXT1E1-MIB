"Program the receiver sensitivity.

Warning: This is a Private Mode activity that should only be
performed by or under the direct supervision of qualified
personnel.

Options:
t1e1EGLLow (1): Program a low sensitivity of -30 dB. This is 
recommended for most applications.

t1e1EGLHigh (2): Program a high sensitivity of -36 dB. This
setting could be required for particular applications, however,
with this level of sensitivity the receiver will be more
susceptible to crosstalk and the receiver's jitter tolerance
will suffer.

Default Value: t1e1EGLLow (1)

	SYNTAX    TimeTicks
		ACCESS    read-only
		STATUS    mandatory
		DESCRIPTION

no such event has occurred since system startup, then the value
will be zero."
