	     at the point of creation of the bgpM2PeerTable row
	     entry.  While its value is guaranteed to be unique at
	     any time, it is otherwise opaque to the management
	     application with respect to its value or the contiguity
	     of bgpM2PeerIndex row instance values across rows of
	     the bgpM2PeerTable.  It is used to provide an index
	     structure for other tables whose data is logically
	     per-peer.

	     For explicitly configured peers, this value will remain
	     consistent until this row is deleted by deleting the
	     configured peers.	Unconfigured peers will generate
	     a monotonically increasing number when a BGP FSM is
	     built to process the peering session.  Values in the
	     bgpM2PeerTable and other tables utilizing bgpM2PeerIndex
	     are expected to remain in existence for an arbitrary
	     time after the unconfigured peer has been deleted
	     in order to allow management applications to extract
	     useful management information for those peers.  Thus,
	     an unconfigured peer using the same indices as the
	     bgpM2PeerTable that comes up while this row still
	     exists will re-utilize the same row."
