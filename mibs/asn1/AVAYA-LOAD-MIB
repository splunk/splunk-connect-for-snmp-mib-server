-- =========================================================
-- 
-- Overview:
-- 
-- The Avaya Load MIB defines upload, download and copy of application software
-- and configuration information.
-- 
-- The avGenOperations group
-- 
--   Each row in the avGenOpTable represents an operation that this system 
--   can perform. A walk of this table should provide a list of available 
--   operations that can be performed by the system. 
--   The avGenOpTable contains all configuration information necessary to 
--   perform upload, download, and copy operations within the system.  
--   Source, Destination, operational 
--   trigger, opertional status and error logging information are contained 
--   on a per row basis (each row again representing an operation that 
--   this table can perform).
-- 
-- The avGenApplication Group
-- 
--   Table of Application (FILE) entries.  Each row uniquely defines an
--   application in the system.  Applications can be defined as any entity 
--   that can be read or written from or to the system.  This includes 
--   software images, boot code, configuration files, prom code, etc. 
--   Each row contains information used to catalog the application (FILE)
--   entries present in the system. A walk of the avGenAppFileTable should
--   provide a directory-like listing of all application software, 
--   bootcode, configuration files and misc. accessable embedded software
--   in the system.  Each entry contains information about the application 
--   such as type, size, version number and date stamp.

--
-- Version 200507031611Z - Shlomi Biton.
-- 1. Remove the fileAlreadyExistsInDirectory(18) error code in AvGenOpLastFailureIndex.
-- 2. Add the avLoadApplMemTable for presenting for each file type the amount of memory 
--    is used, how many bytes are free and used. 
-- 
-- Version 200505100945Z - Shlomi Biton.
-- 1. Updating the MIB to include annoucements file transfer support using SCP protocol.
-- 	a. Announcements file will be presented in Module ID == 9.
--  b. Adding the Values uploadAnnouncements(18), downloadAnnouncements(19), and
--     renameFile(20) to avGenOpIndex.
--  c. New Errors use for with announcement files:
--    	readOnlyFile(15) - For cases where management system tries to erase/delete file
-- 			which is read-only.   
-- 		emptyFile(16) - When trying to erase/upload file that does not exists or size with size 0.
--      noEnoughFreeMemoryLeft(17) - When trying to download a file to the device and there is 
--			no place left to it. 
-- 		fileAlreadyExistsInDirectory(18) - when trying to download file which already exists
--			in the directory (in one of the other AvGenAppFileTable rows, if we want to update 
-- 			it we need to use the same row in the table).
--	d. Adding new type of announcementFile(20) to avGenAppFileType.
--  e. The field avGenAppFileSize is used as R/O instead of read-create.
--  f. Adding note to AvGenAppFileRowStatus - destroy(6) value that Used to delete Applications
--	 	in the system. Used only for destroying rows will file size 0. 
--		i.e. erase shall be done in operation mib and then destroy the row.
-- 2. Adding avGenLoadConnectionState for the SAT Connection status under new branch 
--    avLoadGeneralInformation. I.e. for cases where the agent
--    must log into the CM server via SAT connection to collect the data. The agent retrieves the 
--    data via the SAT and converts it into SNMP MIB data which is accessible via standard SNMP get 
--    commands. 
-- 3. Using renameAnnouncement(20) and eraseAnnouncement(21) enumerations in avGenOpIndex 
--    instead of renameFile(20) and eraseFile(9).
--    
--
-- Version 200501261842Z - Shlomi Biton.
-- 1. Adding avGenOpLastFailureIndex and avGenOpLastFailureDisplay as part of the varbind
-- to avDownloadFault and avUploadFault.
--
-- Version 200501170822Z - Shlomi Biton.
-- 1. The avGenAppFileVersionNumber was changed to be DisplayString instead of OCTET STRING. In
--    order to solve the presentation problem of this firmware version in the Lucent Load MIB. 
-- 2. Add the notification section for download/upload events.
--    a. Use a new list of varbind of: avLoadSysDescription, avGenOpModuleId , avGenAppFileId, 
--    avGenAppFileName, avGenAppFileDescription, avGenAppFileVersionNumber
-- 	  b. Add the varbind avLoadSeverity for the trap severity.
--    c. Use general traps for upload/download instead of specific trap for each type of software. 
-- 3. Add the following new mib items:
--    a. The avGenOpDownloadProxy is the location of a CLAN board that will serve as the proxy for 
--    the firmware download of a TDM-based board, since these boards are unable to perform the 
--    download operation themselves. The CLAN will be responsible for obtaining the image.
--    b. The avGenAppFilePortNetwork is the Port Network that a downloadable TN board is location 
--    in. This is useful to the customer in determining the Download Proxy, since location is a 
--    factor in determining whether a download is possible. This will represent the possible Port 
--    Networks of 1 through 64.
--    c. The avGenAppFileDuplStatus is the duplication state of the various TN boards that can be 
--    duplicated. These include the IPSI and Crossfire boards. This is also useful to the customer 
--    in order for them to determine whether a board is active or not. Typical operation is to 
--    update the firmware on the standbys first, then have the standbys become active, followed by 
--    updating the firmware on the standbys that were orginially active. This will help the customer 
--    see if they are selecting an active board for upgrading.
-- 4. Adding two new states to avGenOpRunningState:
--    a. blocked(8) - to be used when the Load MIB agent is unable to perform a requested operation,
--    this could happen in CM if a firmware download job was submitted directly from the SAT. Since 
--    CM only accepts one job at a time, the Load MIB agent will be blocked until that job completes.
--    b. reset(9) - to be used to request a reset only of a TN board, this capability is a existing 
--    capability in Software Update Manager that we want to support directly in the Load MIB.
