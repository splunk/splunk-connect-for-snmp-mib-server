    DESCRIPTION
        "This module defines objects for management of the 'Security'
        mechanism in Xedia devices.

        Security Model:

        In all cases, a top level, 'object-wide' security check is performed, 
        followed by the 'instantiated object' (particular instance or row) check, 
        if specified, followed by the security function (when appropriate),  
        followed by the required 'parent' security checks, in the same order."

xsecurityObjID OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      OBJECT IDENTIFIER
    MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The Object Identifier of a known object, or a particular instance
    of the object.  Objects can be end nodes, which contain readable
    data, or they can be inner nodes which are only used to identify
    the end points.  The object ID can be secified by using the complete 
    OID of an object, with the exact OID digits making up the instance 
    portion of the object when needed.  In all cases, an 'end of ID'
    marker of decimal '999' will be used to separate the base objectID
    from the instance portion of the whole OID.

    When '.0' instance information is specified, the 'object-wide' security 
    levels of the object are modified.  But, when specific instance 
    information is specified, the security levels of a particular instance 
    are modifed.  Then,only requests with exactly matching instance 
    information are validated against the specified levels.
    
    The '.0' also indicates where the 'base' oid ends and the instance
    information (if any) begins.  This way, it is possible to identify
    high level nodes with specific instances matching lower level nodes.

    ie: ifEntry.1 --> ifEntry.999.1 filters out all instances of '1'.

        The '999' is necessary since ifEntry.1 looks exactly the same
        as ifIndex.
