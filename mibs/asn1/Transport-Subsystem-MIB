  SnmpTransportModel ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
      STATUS       current
      DESCRIPTION "An identifier that uniquely identifies a
                   Transport Model of the Transport Subsystem within
                   the SNMP Management Architecture.

                   The values for transportModel are allocated as
                   follows:

                   - The zero value does not identify any particular
                     transport model.

                   - Values between 1 and 255, inclusive, are reserved
                     for standards-track Transport Models and are
                     managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
                     (IANA).
                   - Values greater than 255 are allocated to
                     enterprise-specific Transport Models.  An
                     enterprise-specific transportModel value is defined
                     to be:
                     enterpriseID * 256 + transport model within
                     enterprise

                     For example, the fourth Transport Model defined by
                     the enterprise whose enterpriseID is 1 would be
                     260.

                   This scheme for allocation of transportModel
                   values allows for a maximum of 255 standards-
                   based Transport Models, and for a maximum of
                   256 Transport Models per enterprise.

                   It is believed that the assignment of new
                   transportModel values will be rare in practice
                   because the larger the number of simultaneously
                   utilized Transport Models, the larger the
                   chance that interoperability will suffer.
                   Consequently, it is believed that such a range
                   will be sufficient.  In the unlikely event that
                   the standards committee finds this number to be
                   insufficient over time, an enterprise number
                   can be allocated to obtain an additional 256
                   possible values.

                   Note that the most significant bit must be zero;
                   hence, there are 23 bits allocated for various
                   organizations to design and define non-standard
                   transportModels.  This limits the ability to
                   define new proprietary implementations of Transport
                   Models to the first 8,388,608 enterprises.

                   It is worthwhile to note that, in its encoded
                   form, the transportModel value will normally
                   require only a single byte since, in practice,
                   the leftmost bits will be zero for most messages
                   and sign extension is suppressed by the encoding
                   rules.

                   As of this writing, there are several values
                   of transportModel defined for use with SNMP or
                   reserved for use with supporting MIB objects.
                   They are as follows:

                       0  reserved for 'any'
                       1  reserved for UDP
                       2  reserved for TCP
