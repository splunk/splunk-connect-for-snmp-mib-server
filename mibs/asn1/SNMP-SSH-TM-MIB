    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The SNMP over SSH transport domain. The corresponding transport
        address is of type SnmpSSHAddress.

        When an SNMP entity uses the snmpSSHDomain transport
        model, it must be capable of accepting messages up to
        and including 8192 octets in size.  Implementation of
        larger values is encouraged whenever possible."

SnmpSSHAddress ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "1a"
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Represents either a hostname encoded in ASCII
        using the IDNA protocol, as specified in RFC3490, followed by
        a colon ':' (ASCII character 0x3A) and a decimal port number
        in ASCII, or an IP address followed by a colon ':'
        (ASCII character 0x3A) and a decimal port number in ASCII.
         The name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

         Values of this textual convention are not directly useable
         as transport-layer addressing information, and require
         runtime resolution. As such, applications that write them
         must be prepared for handling errors if such values are
         not supported, or cannot be resolved (if resolution occurs
         at the time of the management operation).

         The DESCRIPTION clause of TransportAddress objects that may
         have snmpSSHAddress values must fully describe how (and
         when) such names are to be resolved to IP addresses and vice
         versa.

         This textual convention SHOULD NOT be used directly in
         object definitions since it restricts addresses to a
         specific format. However, if it is used, it MAY be used
         either on its own or in conjunction with
         TransportAddressType or TransportDomain as a pair.

         When this textual convention is used as a syntax of an
         index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
         sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58. In this case,
         the OBJECT-TYPE declaration MUST include a 'SIZE' clause
         to limit the number of potential instance sub-identifiers."
