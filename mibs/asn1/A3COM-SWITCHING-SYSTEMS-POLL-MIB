    DESCRIPTION   
            "This table is used to provide remote device monitoring facilities. 
 
            The implementation allows a list of network devices to be set up 
            and polled regularly (or only once) by a variety of protocols. 
            The table can be configured to inform the management station(s) 
            of devices that are not responding to polls or that have started 
            to respond after a period of silence. 
 
            The minimum effort required to do a single poll is 
            1. In one packet, write the address and set a3ComPollAction to  
            activate(2). 
            2. In the next packet, read the a3ComPollReport. 
 
            The minimum effort required to monitor a device is 
            1. In one packet, write the address, set a3ComPollAttempts to 1,  
            set a3ComPollCount to 0 and set a3ComPollAction to activate(2). 
            2. Wait for traps to come in. 
 
            A row in this table is created by setting any read-write member,  
            indexed by the next available index (a3ComPollNextFreeIndex). This 
            method of creation makes the table very user friendly, although 
            a bit harder to detect racing conditions. The suggested method for 
            racing condition detection is by checking the a3ComPollAddress and 
            a3ComPollOwner objects while the a3ComPollReport object is set to 
            active. An example of the indexing of this table is a3ComPollRate.2"

    DESCRIPTION   
            "This defines the method used to interpret the a3ComPollAddress,  
            which implies on the protocol to be used. 
 
            Writing an address to the a3ComPollAddress object causes a default 
            a3ComPollAddressType value to be setup. The default value is 
            derived from the format of the address - four octets means ip(2),  
            four sets of numeric values separated by dot means ipdotted(3), eight 
            and twelve octets separated by colon means ipx(5), and two sets of 
            numeric values separated by a dot means appletalk(6). If the address 
            type cannot be figured out, and this object is not currently set to  
            ipname(4), it will then be set to unknown(1). In other words, this 
            object will remain unchanged if its current value is ipname(4) and 
            a more specific type cannot be given to it. Thus, for the mot part, 
            when setting this object manually, that needs to be done after 
            setting a3ComPollAddress. 
 
            For ip hostname(4), this field must be set manually. Furthermore, 
            DNS client must be locally enabled to allow for conversion from name 
            to ip address.  
 
            If the requested protocol is not supported or is not compatible 
            with the a3ComPollAddress, an error is returned when an attempt is  
            made to set a3ComPollAction to activate(2), and a3ComPollReport will 
            be set to noResource(4). 
 
            This object may not be modified if the associated a3ComPollReport
