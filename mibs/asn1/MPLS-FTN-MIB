   DESCRIPTION
       "This object contains the next available valid value to
        be used for mplsFTNIndex when creating entries in the
        mplsFTNTable.
       
        When creating a new conceptual row (configuration
        entry) in mplsFTNTable with an SNMP SET operation the
        command generator (Network Management Application) must
        first issue a management protocol retrieval operation
        to obtain the current value of this object.
       
        If the Command Responder (agent) does not wish to allow
        creation of more entries in mplsFTNTable, possibly
        because of resource exhaustion, this object MUST return
        a value of 0.
       
        If a non-zero value is returned it must determine
        whether the value is indeed still unused since two
        Network Management Applications may attempt to create a
        row simultaneously and use the same value.
       
        If it is currently unused and the SET succeeds, the
        agent MUST change the value of this object to a
        currently unused non-zero value (according to an
        implementation specific algorithm) or zero (if no
        further row creation will be permitted).
       
        If the value is in use, however, the SET fails and the
        Network Management Application must then reread this
        object to obtain a new usable value."

        bits to be specified.

        MPLS-LSR MIB when the NHLFE entry is a non-TE LSP, or

   DESCRIPTION
       "This table contains objects for mapping previously
        defined entries in mplsFTNTable to interfaces.
       
        This table provides the capability to activate or map
        FTN entries defined in mplsFTNTable to specific
        interfaces in the system. FTN entries are compared with
        incoming packets in the order in which they are applied
        on an interface. For this reason, this table provides a
        mechanism to 'insert' an FTN entry between two existing
        FTN entries already applied on an interface.
       
        Using this linked-list structure, one can retrieve FTN
        entries in the order of application on a per-interface
        basis as follows:
       
        - To determine the first FTN entry on an interface
          with index ifIndex perform a GETNEXT retrieval
          operation on mplsFTNMapIndex.ifIndex.0.0; the
          returned object, if one exists, is (say)
          mplsFTNMapIndex.ifIndex.0.n. Then the index of the
          first FTN entry applied on this interface is n.
        
        - To determine the FTN entry applied after the one
          indexed by n perform a GETNEXT retrieval operation on
          mplsFTNMapIndex.ifIndex.n.0; the returned object, if
          one exists, is (say) mplsFTNMapIndex.ifIndex.n.m.
          Then the index of the next FTN entry applied on this
          interface is m.
       
        Use the above steps to retrieve all the applied FTN
        entries on a per-interface basis in application order.
        Note that the number of retrieval operations is the
        same as the number of applied FTN entries (i.e. the
        minimum number of GETNEXT operations needed using any
        indexing scheme)."

        on the interface and the index of the current FTN
        entry. This linked-list indexing style structure allows
        FTN entries to be inserted at arbitrary positions in
        the list. Agents MUST NOT allow the same FTN entries to
        be applied multiple times to the same interface. Agents
        MUST NOT allow the creation of rows in this table until
        the corresponding rows are created in the mplsFTNTable.
        If the corresponding row in the FTN table is destroyed,
        the agent MUST destroy the corresponding entries in
        this table as well. Although it is strongly recommended
        that managers destroy rows in this table in such a way
        that keeps the remainder of the table consistent,
        agents MUST ultimately make sure that if an entry in
        this table is destroyed, that inconsistencies in the
        table are not allowed to occur. To this end, rows that
        are no longer appropriate should be taken out of
        service."
