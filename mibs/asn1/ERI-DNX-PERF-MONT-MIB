            This number will be used throughout the system to identify 
            a unique link. The format is represented using an IP address 
            syntax (4 byte string). Note that the maximum valid link 
            number will vary depending on the specified carrier and framing 
            options. For example, an octal T1/E1 device has 8 DS1 links but the 
            DS3 has 28 DS1 links.
            
               The 1st byte is reserved for future Nest Number use

               The 4th byte is reserved for future use
