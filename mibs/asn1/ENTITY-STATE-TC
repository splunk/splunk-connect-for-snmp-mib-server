            An Alarm [ALARM-MIB] is a persistent indication
            of an error or warning condition.

            When no bits of this attribute are set, then none
            of the value of under repair is set, the resource is
            currently being repaired, which depending on the
            implementation, may make the other values in this bit
            string unreliable.

            When the value of 'critical' is set, one or more critical
            alarms are active against the resource. When the value
            of 'major' is set, one or more major alarms are active
            against the resource. When the value of 'minor' is set,
            one or more minor alarms are active against the resource.
            When the value of 'warning' is set, one or more warning
            alarms are active against the resource. When the value
            of 'indeterminate' is set, one or more alarms whose of
            perceived severity cannot be determined are active
            against this resource.

              without the need for initialization activity, and will
              contain the same information as the resource to be
              backed up. A value of 'coldStandy' means that the
              resource is to back-up another resource, but will not
              be immediately able to take over the role of a resource
              to be backed up, and will require some initialization
              activity. A value of 'providingService' means the
              resource is providing service. A value of
               'unknown' means that this resource is unable to
