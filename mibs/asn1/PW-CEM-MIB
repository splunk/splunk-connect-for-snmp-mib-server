      DESCRIPTION 
          "This MIB reports to the PW-MIB. This table is indexed by 
           the same index that was created for the associated entry 
           in the PW VC Table (in the PW-MIB). 
    
             - The PwVcIndex. 
             - The PwVcInstance. 
    
           An entry is created in this table by the agent for every 
           entry in the pwVc table with a VcType of 'cem'. 
    
           This table provides per CEM VC performance information. 
           HC (high capacity) counters are required for some counts 
           due to the high speeds expected with CEM services. A SONET 
           path of width 48 (STS-48c) can rollover non-HC counters in 
           a few minutes. 
            
           CEM bridges the SONET and packet worlds. In the packet 
           world, counts typically start from the time of service 
           creation - and don't stop. In the SONET world, counts are 
           kept in 15 minute intervals. The CEM-MIB supports both 
           methods. Thestats in the VC CEM table count forever. The 
           15 minute interval counts are in the tables following this. 
            
           NOTE: Outbound errors are currently not considered in the 
           CEM-MIB. It is assumed that CEM packets are forwarded as 
           they are generated. i.e., It is assumed that there are no 
           congestion issues at the point of CEM adaptation."
