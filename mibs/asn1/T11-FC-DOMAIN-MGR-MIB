    DESCRIPTION
           "The configured Domain_ID of the local switch on this
           Fabric, or zero if no Domain_ID has been configured.
           The meaning of this object depends on
           t11DmConfigDomainIdType object.

           If t11DmConfigDomainIdType is 'preferred', then domain ID
           configured is called 'preferred Domain_ID'. The valid
           values are between 0 and 239. In a situation where
           this domain could not be assigned, any other domain ID
           would be acceptable. The value '0' means any domain ID.

           If t11DmConfigDomainIdType is 'static', then domain ID is
           called 'static Domain_ID' and valid values are between
           1 and 239. In a situation where this domain was
           non-zero but could not be assigned, no other domain ID
           would be acceptable.

           If the Domain Manager is enabled on the Fabric, then an
           RDI (Request Domain_ID) will be sent requesting this
           Domain_ID. If a Domain_ID is not able to be granted
           in the case of 'preferred', or if a 'static' Domain_ID is
           configured but not able to be granted, then it is an error
           condition.  When this error occurs, the E_Ports on that
           Fabric will be isolated and the administrator will be
           informed via a 't11DmDomainIdNotAssigned' notification.

           If the domain manager is not enabled, then the static
           Domain_ID is assumed to be granted, if it has been
           configured (to a valid number).

           If either of the domain IDs are not configured with a
           non-zero value on this Fabric and if the domain manager
           is not enabled, then

           - switch will isolate all its E_Ports on the Fabric.

t11DmIfTable  OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX     SEQUENCE OF T11DmIfEntry
    MAX-ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
           "This table contains interface configuration of the
           domain manager per Fabric.

           An entry in this table is automatically created when
           an E_Port becomes non-isolated and there is an
           entry in t11DmTable for the Fabric.

           An entry is deleted automatically from this table if:
           a) the correponding interface becomes non-existent, or
           b) the correponding interface becomes a non-E_Port
              and all the writable objects has default values.
                             or
           c) the t11DmTable entry for the corresponding Fabric
              is deleted.

           Creating entries in this table via t11DmIfRowStatus
           provides the means to specify non-default parameter values
           for an interface at a time when that interface is either
           down or is a non-E_Port.

           So an entry in this table exists when one or both of
           these conditions holds:
           - one or more configuration parameters have non-default
             values for an interface which is either down or a
             non-E_Port and corresponding Fabric has an entry in
             the t11DmTable, and/or
           - the interface is an E_Port and it is up.

           This has a number of consequences:
           - an entry exists for a non-E_Port or an E_Port which is
             down whenever that interface has non-default parameters and
             the corresponding Fabric has an entry in the t11DmTable;
           - an entry is not able to be created (via t11DmIfRowStatus)
             for an interface with default parameters; instead, the
             agent creates/deletes an entry for an interface with
             default parameters according to whether the E_Port is
             up or down.
           - an entry is not able to be created via t11DmIfRowStatus
             unless non-default parameter values are (simultaneously)
             configured for an interface which is a non-E_Port or a
             down interface, and the correspoding Fabric has
             an entry in the t11DmTable.
           - deleting an entry via RowStatus when either the
             interface is down and configured with non-default
             values or the interface is up, is equivalent to
             resetting its parameters to their default values.
             If the interface is down and was configured with
             default values, then the entry would be deleted."
