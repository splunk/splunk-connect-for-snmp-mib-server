        active(1), no other objects in the conceptual row can

        To create a row in this table, a manager sets this  
        object to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5).

        appropriately configured, the value of the  
        corresponding instance of the `vrrpOperationsRowStatus' 
        column will be read as notReady(3).   
        In particular, a newly created row cannot be made

        of vrrpOperationsInetAddrType, vrrpOperationsVrId and  
        vrrpOperationsPrimaryIpAddr has been set and there is

        IP address. 
 
        notInService(2) should be used to administratively  
        bring the row down. 
 
        A typical order of operation to add a row is: 
        1. Create a row in vrrpOperationsTable with  
        createAndWait(5). 
        2. Create one or more corresponding rows in 
        vrrpAssociatedIpAddrTable. 
        3. Populate the vrrpOperationsEntry. 
        4. set vrrpOperationsRowStatus to active(1). 
 
        A typical order of operation to delete an entry is: 
        1. Set vrrpOperationsRowStatus to notInService(2). 
        2. Set the corresponding rows in  
        vrrpAssociatedIpAddrTable to destroy(6) to delete the  
        entry.  
        3. set vrrpOperationsRowStatus to destroy(6) to delete
