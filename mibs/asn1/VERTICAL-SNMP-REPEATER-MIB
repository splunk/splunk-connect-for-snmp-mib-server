     --  This MIB module combines the syntax of snmp v1
     --  definition for IEEE 802.3 repeaters (RFC 1516) with
     --  the additional features defined in the snmp v2 version
     --  (RFC 2108). 
     -- 
     --  The structure of this MIB closely follows that of the
     --  definition in RFC 2108, with the relative tree structure
     --  of the variables unchanged. The following changes
     --  are salient :
     --  1)   All variables names as mentioned in RFC 2108 have been 
     --       preceded by the letter "v" to reinforce the fact that 
     --       this is vertical's private implementaion
     --  2)   All deprecated items in RFC 2108 have been removed 
     --       to provide better readability.
     --  3)   All v2 specific data types have been replaced with
     --       corresponding v1 data types. 
     --  4)   Traps have redefined to reflect v1 syntax 
     --  5)   Added vrptrGroupSlotNumber in vrptrGroupTable
     --  6)   Added vrptrPortLinkState
     --  7)   Changed the syntax of some Monitor Port items to Integer from 
     --       Counter to show values -1, (unSupported)

               section 9 [IEEE 802.3 Std] for a 10Mb/s repeater,
               and to the START state of Fig 27-2 in section 27
               of that standard for a 100Mb/s repeater.

               Setting this object to noReset(1) has no effect.
               The agent will always return the value noReset(1)
               when this object is read.

               After receiving a request to set this variable to
               reset(2), the agent is allowed to delay the reset
               for a short period.  For example, the implementor
               may choose to delay the reset long enough to allow
               the SNMP response to be transmitted.  In any
               event, the SNMP response must be transmitted.

               This action does not reset the management counters
               defined in this document nor does it affect the
               portAdminStatus parameters.  Included in this
               action is the execution of a disruptive Self-Test
               with the following characteristics:  a) The nature
               of the tests is not specified.  b) The test resets
               the repeater but without affecting management
               information about the repeater.  c) The test does
               not inject packets onto any segment.  d) Packets
               received during the test may or may not be
               transferred.  e) The test does not interfere with
               management functions.

               After performing this self-test, the agent will
               update the repeater health information (including
               rptrInfoOperStatus), and send a rptrInfoResetEvent

               measurement point within the state machine.

               Notes:

               ShortEvents may indicate externally
               generated noise hits which will cause the repeater
               to transmit Runts to its other ports, or propagate

               transmitting DTE and damaged frames to the rest of
               the network.

               Implementors may wish to consider selecting the
               ShortEventMaxTime towards the lower end of the
               allowed tolerance range to accommodate bit losses
               suffered through physical channel devices not
               budgeted for within this standard.

               The significance of this attribute is different
               in 10 and 100 Mb/s collision domains.  Clause 9

               interconnect ports of other repeaters.  Clause
               27 repeaters do not perform fragment extension.

               A discontinuity may occur in the value

               with the corresponding rptrMonitorPortUpper32Octets
               counters for all of the ports in the repeater.

               This statistic provides an indicator of the total
               data transferred within the repeater.

               This two-counter mechanism is provided for those
               network management protocols that do not support
               64-bit counters (e.g. SNMP V1) and are used to
               manage a repeater type of 100Mb/s.

               Conformance clauses for this MIB are defined such
               that implementation of this object is not required
               in a system which does not support 100Mb/s.
               However, systems with mixed 10 and 100Mb/s ports
               may implement this object across all ports,
               including 10Mb/s.  If this object is implemented,
               it must be according to the definition in the first
               paragraph of this description; that is, the value
               of this object MUST be a valid count."

--
--               This counter is a 64-bit (high-capacity) version
--               of rptrMonUpper32TotalOctets and rptrMonTotalOctets.
--               It should be used by network management protocols
--               which support 64-bit counters (e.g. SNMPv2).
