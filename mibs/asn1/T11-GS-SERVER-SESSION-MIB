    DESCRIPTION
            "The MIB module for the management of Fibre Channel
             Server Sessions as defined generically in FC-GS-5
             to represent a collection of one or more requests
             for the session's server.  Such a session is
             started by a Server Session Begin (SSB) request and
             terminated by a Server Session End (SSE) request.
             In particular, GS-5 Server Sessions are used by
             Enhanced Zoning Management."

             all fabrics known to those switches."
    REFERENCE
             "ANSI INCITS xxx/200x, T11/Project 1677-D/Rev 8.2,
              Fibre Channel - Generic Services-5 (FC-GS-5),

t11GssSessionEntry OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX       T11GssSessionEntry

    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
            "Each entry contains information specific to a
             GS-5 Server session for a particular fabric on
             a particular switch (identified by values of
             fcmInstanceIndex and fcmSwitchIndex).  Note that
             each switch can have at most one Server session
             per fabric.

             Several different types of Servers are defined in
             FC-GS-5.  The behavior of a Server with respect to
             commands received within a Server session is specified for
             each type of Server.  For some types, parameter changes
             can only be made within the context of a session.  That
             is, some types of changes can only made while a session is
             established.  So, in order to make such changes via an
             SNMP SetRequest, some types of Servers require that a
             corresponding entry in this table exist, and in such
             cases, the required entry in this table is created
             implicitly (by the agent on receipt of the SetRequest)
             as and when necessary, with t11GssSessionOwnerType
             having a value of 'snmp'."

           In a fabric conformant to FC-SW-4, multiple Virtual Fabrics
           can operate within one (or more) physical infrastructures,
           and this index value is used to uniquely identify a
           particular (physical or virtual) fabric within a physical
           infrastructure.

           In a fabric conformant to versions earlier than FC-SW-4,
           only a single fabric could operate within a physical
           infrastructure, and thus, the value of this fabric index
           was defined to always be 1."
