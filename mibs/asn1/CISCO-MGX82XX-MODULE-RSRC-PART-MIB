    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module to configure the resource partition
        on service modules(cards) supported in MGX82xx and
        MGX88xx products.

        This MIB is supported in following Service Modules:
          AUSM (ATM UNI Service Module)
          CESM (Circuit Emulation Service Module)
          FRSM (Frame Relay Service Module)
          VISM (Voice Interworking Service Module)
          PXM1 (Processor Switch Module)

        Terminlogies used:

        LCN  : Logical Connection Number.
        GLCN : Global LCN.

        Controller - Software ( and possibly hardware) which manages
                     topology and network resources.
		     This performs source routing for ent-to-end SVCs,
                     including general call acceptance GCAC, setup calls
                     with other controllers.
                  PNNI and MPLS are examples for the Controller."

    REVISION    "200304180000Z"
    DESCRIPTION
        "Initial version of the MIB.

        The content of this MIB was originally available
        in CISCO-WAN-AXIPOP-MIB defined using SMIv1.
        The applicable objects from CISCO-WAN-AXIPOP-MIB
        are defined using SMIv2 in this MIB. Also the
        descriptions of some of the objects have been 
        modified."

                   each port. The number for each controller is

         portControllerBased(3): a certain number of (G)LCNs available

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object identifies the controller
        managing the partition.

	 par(1) -  Portable Auto Route(PAR). This is a VSI Master controller
	           implementing Cisco Proprietary protocol for network
	           routing and topology in a Network containing only 
		   Cisco Switches.

	 pnni(2) - Private Network-to-Network Interface (PNNI) controller.
		   The PNNI protocol is used between private ATM Switches
		   and between groups of ATM switches. This protocol is 
		   defined for distributing topology information between
		   switches and clusters of switches.

	 tag(3)  - Label(tag) Switch Controller(TSC).The LSC Implements MPLS
	           (Multi Protocol Label Switching) protocol. The LSC is 
		   a router which is capable of controlling the operation
		   of a separate ATM switch so that the two of them 
                   together function as a single ATM-LSR
                   (ATM Label Switch Router).
		   The LSC controls the operation of the ATM Switch
		   using a 'Switch Control Protocol', which allows the
		   LSC to setup and remove cross-connects on the ATM
		   switch, to discover the configuration and capabilities
		   of the controlled switch, and to gather statistics from
		   the controlled switch."
