    DESCRIPTION
       "The Textual Conventions defined in this module should be used
       whenever a Differentiated Services Code Point is used in a MIB."
    REVISION "200205090000Z"
    DESCRIPTION
       "Initial version, published as RFC 3289."
    ::= { mib-2 96 }

Dscp ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "d"
    STATUS   current
    DESCRIPTION
       "A Differentiated Services Code-Point that may be used for
       marking a traffic stream."
    REFERENCE
        "RFC 2474, RFC 2780"
    SYNTAX   Integer32 (0..63)

DscpOrAny ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "d"
    STATUS   current
    DESCRIPTION
       "The IP header Differentiated Services Code-Point that may be
       used for discriminating among traffic streams. The value -1 is
       used to indicate a wild card i.e. any value."
    REFERENCE
        "RFC 2474, RFC 2780"
    SYNTAX   Integer32 (-1 | 0..63)

IndexInteger ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "d"
    STATUS   current
    DESCRIPTION
       "An integer which may be used as a table index."
    SYNTAX   Unsigned32 (1..4294967295)

IndexIntegerNextFree ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "d"
    STATUS   current
    DESCRIPTION
       "An integer which may be used as a new Index in a table.

       The special value of 0 indicates that no more new entries can be
       created in the relevant table.

       When a MIB is used for configuration, an object with this SYNTAX
       always contains a legal value (if non-zero) for an index that is
       not currently used in the relevant table. The Command Generator
       (Network Management Application) reads this variable and uses the
       (non-zero) value read when creating a new row with an SNMP SET.
       When the SET is performed, the Command Responder (agent) must
       determine whether the value is indeed still unused; Two Network
       Management Applications may attempt to create a row
       (configuration entry) simultaneously and use the same value. If
       it is currently unused, the SET succeeds and the Command
       Responder (agent) changes the value of this object, according to
       an implementation-specific algorithm.  If the value is in use,
       however, the SET fails.  The Network Management Application must
       then re-read this variable to obtain a new usable value.

       An OBJECT-TYPE definition using this SYNTAX MUST specify the
       relevant table for which the object is providing this
       functionality."
    SYNTAX   Unsigned32 (0..4294967295)

IfDirection ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
       "IfDirection specifies a direction of data travel on an
       interface. 'inbound' traffic is operated on during reception from
       the interface, while 'outbound' traffic is operated on prior to
       transmission on the interface."
    SYNTAX  INTEGER {
                inbound(1),     -- ingress interface
                outbound(2)     -- egress interface
}
