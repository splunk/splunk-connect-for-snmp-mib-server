          A value of networkTCF implies that date rate management

          involved in the training and data rate management procedure, 
          including the generation of the TCF training signal.

          Command) and NSS (Non-Standard Facilities Set-up). The
          NSF code is overridden to prevent the group 3 fax
          machines from synchronizing with each other on the basis
          of a protocol other the ITU T-series recommendations.
          If this proprietary synchronization is prevented, the
          group 3 fax machines will synchronize to the standard
          T-series protocol. This action is necessary if the fax
          relay capability of the media gateway is limited 
          to the T-series recommendations. As defined in T.35, the NSF 
          code consists of a one-byte Country Code, a two-byte 
          Terminal Provider Code (also called the Vendor Code), and a 
          variable-length (up to 255 bytes) Terminal Provider-Oriented

          Terminal Provider Code are overridden with the values of the 
          t38NSFCountryCode and t38NSFVendorCode respectively, while
          the Terminal Provider-Oriented Code (which is a bit-map of

         "The Country Code in the NSF code is a 
          single-byte field identifying the country where
          the group 3 fax equipment with non-standard 
          capabilities were manufactured. 

          There are un ratified proposals on the table to extend 
          this to a two-byte field. If the fax relay capability of the
          gateway is limited to the ITU T-series protocol, the value 
          of the t38NSFCountryCode object is to be written into the 
          Country Code field to preclude non-standard synchronization 
          of the group 3 faxs terminals. 
          Since a value of 0x00 refers to Japan, and a value of 0xFF 
          is a Country Code extension mechanism, these cannot be used 
          to disable non-standard synchronization. 

          The t38NSFCountryCode value used to override NSF-based
          synchronization is 0xAD (173). 
          If the Country Code is extended to two bytes in the future, 
          the second byte will be set to 0x00. In conjunction with
          this Country Code, a t38NSFVendorCode value of 0x0051
          is used for NSF suppression. It is not possible to use a 
          value of 0x0000 for this suppression since it refers to
          Compression Labs. 
          To realize NSF suppression, all bytes in the Terminal 
          Provider-Oriented Code field, which describes the 
          manufacturer-specific capabilities,  are set to zeros.

          Error Correcting Mode(ECM). ECM is a feature
          implemented by many new fax devices which 
          improves image quality and page compression
          capabilities through a reliable image data 
          transmission protocol -- ECM. If fax calls
          are failing due to high packet loss then disabling
          T.30 ECM may improve the success rate.
