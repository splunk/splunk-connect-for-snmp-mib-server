--
--  Date:   2/15/2000
--
--  Description:
--
--  This file contains the ASN.1 MIB definition for the timeslot portion
--  of the network level provisioning of an OSAP2K series platform.
--  Network provisioning is defined as the configuration of an OSAP's
--  physical network facing interfaces such as SONET interfaces, ring and
--  interconnect attributes of the paths riding on those SONET interfaces,
--  the break-down of the timeslots (STS-1s and VT1.5s) on those SONET
--  interfaces (timeslot table), logical port mappings to the timeslots,
--  trunk mappings to logical ports and protocol mappings to the trunks.
--
--  This file contains the timeslot table which defines the breakdown of
--  the timeslots riding through the SONET ring and through the SONET
--  interconnects between one or more OSAPs on a ring and adjacent ADM.
--  This table describes timeslots both on the ring and on the interconnect.
--
--  The timeslot table is shared throughout the ring.  It contains the
--  read-write attributes for timeslots and logical ports that shared
--  between each OSAP.

    describes the parent timeslot to the timeslot associated with this row.
    A parent timeslot is another timeslot which is carved into smaller
    timeslots, one of which is this current timeslot.  For example, a row in
    this table describing a VT1.5 always has an outerIndex which identifies
    a row in this table which describes a VT group.  A VT group always has an
    outerIndex that describes a STS-1. The row describing the STS-1 has an 
    outerIndex which identifies a row describing an OC3 SONET interface or 
    perhaps, in the future, an STS12 within an STS48. Thus this object 
    describes a nesting of timeslots.  To continue the previous example: an 
    STS-1 with 28 VT1.5's within it is represented by 36 rows in this table; 
    28 of which identify and describe each VT1.5.  Every 4 VT rows have a 
    corresponding VT group (vtgroup) for a total of 7 more rows.  Each of the
    4 VT1.5 rows that make up the VT group have an indentical value for 
    outerIndex (index of the VT group row that the VT1.5's are associated).  
    Each of the 7 VT group rows have an identical value in outerIndex (index 
    of the STS-1 row that the VT groups are associated)."

    OC-3
      + For an STS-1 carved out of an OC3, acTimeSlotNumber is a number

      + For a VT group carved out of an STS-1 in an OC3, acTimeSlotNumber 
        is a number from 1 to 7.  

      + For a VT1.5 carved out of an VT group, acTimeSlotNumber is a number
        from 1 to 4.  


    OC-48
      + For an STS-1 carved out of an OC48, acTimeSlotNumber is a number
        from 1 to 48.  

      + For an STS-3 carved out of an OC48, acTimeSlotNumber is a number

        1, 13, 25, or 37

    DESCRIPTION
    "The type of protection switching to be used if independent path level
    protection switching is enabled on this timeslot.  This object is only
    relevant for the ring side.  Note that ODP is used on shared trunks
    that are either FR or TLS trunks.  In either case, these shared trunks
    can be either STS-1, a VT1.5 or a bundle of VT1.5's.

      not-used:     Timeslot is provisioned only over a linear interconnet.
                    Timeslot is not protected at this level in the Timeslot
                    hierarchy. Example: A VT1.5 row when protection switching
                    is done at the STS-1 level

      unprotected:  Timeslot is unprotected. One significance of this is that
                    if this timeslot becomes unavailable, it will not remain
                    in service by bumping another peer timeslot using the
                    same timeslot on another fiber.

      odp:          Appian's Optical Data Protection. ODP is used on shared
                    trunks that are either FR or TLS trunks.

      uspr:         Traditional UPSR can be used on non-shared timeslots such
                    as PPP trunks and TDM service trunks.

                   transmitting fiber. ChassisSlot 2 indicates the timeslot
                   on the eastward facing fiber.

     ring/interconnect:
                   ChassisSlot 1 indicates the timeslot on the westward
                   transmitting fiber and on the linear interconnect fiber
                   on slot 1.  ChassisSlot 2 indicates the timeslot on the
                   eastward transmitting fiber and the linear interconnect
                   fiber on slot 2.

     linear:       ChassisSlot, along with Port, identifies the fiber out
                   of which this timeslot is extracted.
