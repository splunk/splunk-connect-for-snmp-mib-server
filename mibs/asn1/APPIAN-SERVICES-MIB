--  Dated:  11/7/99
--  Author: D. Theriault
--
--  Description:
--
--  The service MIB definition. The service MIB is organized as a common
--  service table, with several service type specific MIB tables. Currently
--  there are three types of services:
--  
--      Internet Access Service (IAS)
--      Transparent LAN Service (TLS)
--      TDM service
--
--  The common service table:
--
--      1. this table is the common thread of all services. Every service,
--         regardless of the service type, will have an entry in this table.
--
--      2. currently, this table is used to create and remove services.
--
--  IAS table:
--
--      1. this table contains only the IAS services.
--
--      2. the objects in this table are applicable only to IAS.
--
--  TLS table and TDM service table are similar to IAS table.

    DESCRIPTION
    "This table is the common thread of all services, regardless of service
    types, in other words, every service would have an entry in this table.

    A service is identified by a tuple of {node, slot, port, channel}.
    The {slot, port} pair identies the access port of a subscriber.
    The port can support multiple services, and each such service is
    identified by a 'service channel'.

    To create a service, a row should be created in this table. When the 
    service type is set, a row is automatically 'created' in the
    appropriate service type specific table. For example, to create an IAS
    service, one first creates a row in this common table, and then set 
    acServiceType to IAS (which triggers the automatic creation of an
    entry in the IAS service table), and then set the all necessary 
    parameters.

    To remove a service, remove the row in this common table only."
